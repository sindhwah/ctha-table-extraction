			<ce:para id="p0120">A great deal of knowledge and skill is required to practise as a doctor. Physicians in the 21st century need to have a comprehensive knowledge of basic and clinical sciences, have good communication skills, be able to perform procedures, work effectively in a team and demonstrate professional and ethical behaviour. But how doctors think, reason and make decisions is arguably their most critical skill. Knowledge is necessary, but not sufficient on its own for good performance and safe care. This chapter describes the principles of clinical decision-making, or clinical reasoning.</ce:para>

			<ce:section-title id="st0015">The problem of diagnostic error</ce:section-title>
			<ce:para id="p0125">It is estimated that diagnosis is wrong 10–15% of the time in specialties such as emergency medicine, internal medicine and general practice. Diagnostic error is associated with greater morbidity than other types of medical error, and the majority is considered to be preventable. For every diagnostic error there are a number of root causes. Studies of misdiagnosis assign three main categories, shown in 
				<ce:cross-ref id="crf0120" refid="b0010">Box 1.1</ce:cross-ref>
				<ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>; however, errors in clinical reasoning play a significant role in the majority of diagnostic adverse events.
			</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0180">Diagnostic error has been defined as ‘a situation in which the clinician has all the information necessary to make the diagnosis but then makes the wrong diagnosis’. Why does this happen? Studies reveal three main reasons:

				<ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>.
			</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0205">Clearly, clinical knowledge is required for sound clinical reasoning, and an incomplete knowledge base or inadequate experience can lead to diagnostic error. However, this chapter focuses on other elements of clinical reasoning: namely, the interpretation of diagnostic tests, cognitive biases and human factors.</ce:para>

			<ce:section-title id="st0020">Clinical reasoning: definitions</ce:section-title>
			<ce:para id="p0210">‘Clinical reasoning’ describes the thinking and decision-making processes associated with clinical practice. It is a clinician's ability to make decisions (often with others) based on all the available clinical information, starting with the history and physical examination. Our understanding of clinical reasoning derives from the fields of education, cognitive psychology and studies of expertise.</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0215">
				<ce:cross-ref id="crf0130" refid="f0010">Figure 1.1</ce:cross-ref>
				<ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/> shows the different elements involved in clinical reasoning. Good clinical skills are fundamental, followed by understanding how to use and interpret diagnostic tests. Other essential elements include an understanding of cognitive biases and human factors, and the ability to think about one's own thinking (which is explained in more detail later). Other key elements of clinical reasoning include patient-centred evidence-based medicine (EBM) and shared decision-making with patients and/or carers.

			<ce:para id="p0220">Even with major advances in medical technology, the history remains the most important part of the clinical decision-making process. Studies show that physicians make a diagnosis in 70–90% of cases from the history alone. It is important to remember that a good history is gathered not only from the patient but also, if necessary (and with consent if required), from all available sources: for example, paramedic and emergency department notes, eye-witnesses, relatives and/or carers.</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0225">Clinicians need to be aware of the diagnostic usefulness of clinical features in the history and examination. For example, students are taught that meningitis presents with the following features:

For example, many patients with meningitis do not have classical signs of meningeal irritation (Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign and nuchal rigidity). In one prospective study, they had likelihood ratios of around 1, meaning they carried little diagnostic weight (

			<ce:para id="p0245">Likelihood ratios (LR) are clinical diagnostic weights. An LR of greater than 1 increases the probability of disease (the higher the value, the greater the probability). Similarly, an LR of less than 1 decreases the probability of disease. LRs are developed against a diagnostic standard (e.g. in the case of meningitis, lumbar puncture results), so do not exist for all clinical findings. LRs illustrate how an individual clinical finding changes the probability of a disease. For example, in a person presenting with headache and fever, the clinical finding of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness) may carry little weight in deciding whether to perform a lumbar puncture because LRs do not determine the prior probability of disease; they reflect only how a single clinical finding changes it. Clinicians have to take all the available information from the history and physical examination into account. If the overall clinical probability is high to begin with, a clinical finding with an LR of around 1 does not change this.</ce:para>

				<ce:para id="p0285">Most tests provide quantitative results (i.e. a value on a continuous numerical scale). In order to classify quantitative results as normal or abnormal, it is necessary to define a cut-off point. Many quantitative measurements in populations have a Gaussian or ‘normal’ distribution. By convention, the normal range is defined as those values that encompass 95% of the population, or 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. This means that 2.5% of the normal population will have values above, and 2.5% will have values below the normal range. For this reason, it is more appropriate to talk about the ‘reference range’ rather than the ‘normal range’ (

Some tests are very dependent on the skill of the operator and are also affected by the patient's body habitus and clinical state; ultrasound of the heart and abdomen are examples.

				<ce:para id="p0390">Diagnostic tests have characteristics termed ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’. Sensitivity is the ability to detect true positives; specificity is the ability to detect true negatives. Even a very good test, with 95% sensitivity, will miss 1 in 20 people with the disease. Every test therefore has ‘false positives’ and ‘false negatives’ (

				<ce:para id="p0400">A very sensitive test will detect most disease but generate abnormal findings in healthy people. A negative result will therefore reliably exclude disease but a positive result does not mean the disease is present – it means further evaluation is required. On the other hand, a very specific test may miss significant pathology but is likely to establish the diagnosis beyond doubt when the result is positive. All tests differ in their sensitivity and specificity, and clinicians require a working knowledge of the tests they use in this respect.</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0405">In choosing how a test is used to guide decision-making there is a trade-off between sensitivity versus specificity. For example, defining an exercise electrocardiogram (

On the other hand, a cut-off point of 2.0 mm of ST depression would detect most cases of important coronary artery disease with far fewer false positives. This trade-off is illustrated by the receiver operating characteristic curve of the test (

				<ce:para id="p0410">An extremely important concept is this: the probability that a person has a disease depends on the pre-test probability, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test. For example, imagine that an elderly lady has fallen and hurt her left hip. On examination, the hip is extremely painful to move and she cannot stand. However, her hip X-rays are normal. Does she have a fracture?</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0415">The sensitivity of plain X-rays of the hip performed in the emergency department for suspected hip fracture is around 95%. A small percentage of fractures are therefore missed. If our patient has (or is at risk of) osteoporosis, has severe pain on hip movement and cannot bear weight on the affected side, then the clinical probability of hip fracture is high. If, on the other hand, she is unlikely to have osteoporosis, has no pain on hip movement and is able to bear weight, then the clinical probability of hip fracture is low.</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0420">Doctors are continually making judgements about whether something is true, given that something else is true. This is known as ‘conditional probability’. Bayes' Theorem (named after English clergyman Thomas Bayes, 1702–1761) is a mathematical way to describe the post-test probability of a disease by combining pre-test probability, sensitivity and specificity. In clinical practice, doctors are not able to make complex mathematical calculations for every decision they make. In practical terms, the answer to the question of whether there is a fracture is that in a high-probability patient a normal test result does not exclude the condition, but in a low-probability patient it makes it very unlikely. This principle is illustrated in

Take a moment to work this out. In this problem, we have removed clinical probability and are only considering prevalence. The answer is at the end of the chapter.</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0435">Predictive values combine sensitivity, specificity and prevalence. Sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the test; the population does not change this.

				<ce:para id="p0445">Post-test probability and predictive values are different. Post-test probability is the probability of a disease after taking into account new information from a test result. Bayes' Theorem can be used to calculate post-test probability for a patient in any population. The pre-test probability of disease is decided by the doctor; it is a judgement based on information gathered prior to ordering the test. Predictive value is the proportion of patients with a test result who have the disease (or no disease) and is calculated from a table of results in a specific population (see 
					<ce:cross-ref id="crf0175" refid="b0030">Box 1.5</ce:cross-ref>). It is not possible to transfer this value to a different population. This is important to realise because published information about the performance of diagnostic tests may not apply to different populations.
				</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0450">In deciding the pre-test probability of disease, clinicians often neglect to take prevalence into account and this distorts their estimate of probability.

			<ce:para id="p0455">Clinical findings are imperfect and diagnostic tests are imperfect. It is important to recognise that clinicians frequently deal with uncertainty. By expressing uncertainty as probability, new information from diagnostic tests can be incorporated more accurately. However, subjective estimates of probability can sometimes be unreliable. As the section on cognitive biases will demonstrate (see below), intuition can be a source of error.</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0460">Knowing the patient's true state is often unnecessary in clinical decision-making. Sox and colleagues (see ‘
				<ce:cross-ref id="crf0180" refid="st0195">Further information</ce:cross-ref>’) argue that there is a difference between knowing that a disease is present and acting as if it were present. The requirement for diagnostic certainty depends on the penalty for being wrong. Different situations require different levels of certainty before starting treatment. How we communicate uncertainty to patients will be discussed later in this chapter (

			<ce:para id="p0465">The treatment threshold combines factors such as the risks of the test, and the risks versus benefits of treatment. The point at which the factors are all evenly weighed is the threshold. If a test or treatment for a disease is effective and low-risk (e.g. giving antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection), then there is a lower threshold for going ahead. On the other hand, if a test or treatment is less effective or high-risk (e.g. starting chemotherapy for a malignant brain tumour), then greater confidence is required in the clinical diagnosis and potential benefits of treatment first. In principle, if a diagnostic test will not change the management of the patient, then careful consideration should be given to whether it is necessary to do the test at all.</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0470">In summary, test results shift our thinking, but rarely give a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ answer in terms of a diagnosis. Sometimes tests shift the probability of disease by less than we realise.

Two things are going on: one is that humans have two distinct types of processes when it comes to thinking and decision-making – termed ‘type 1’ and ‘type 2’ thinking. The other is that the human brain is wired to jump to conclusions sometimes or to miss things that are obvious. British psychologist and patient safety pioneer James Reason said that, ‘Our propensity for certain types of error is the price we pay for the brain's remarkable ability to think and act intuitively – to sift quickly through the sensory information that constantly bombards us without wasting time trying to work through every situation anew.’ This property of human thinking is highly relevant to clinical decision-making.</ce:para>

With experience, complex procedures become automatic, fast and effortless. The same applies to medical practice. There is evidence that expert decision-making is well served by intuitive thinking. The problem is that although intuitive processing is highly efficient in many circumstances, in others it is prone to error.</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0520">Clinicians use both type 1 and type 2 thinking, and both types are important in clinical decision-making. When encountering a problem that is familiar, clinicians employ pattern recognition and reach a working diagnosis or differential diagnosis quickly (type 1 thinking). When encountering a problem that is more complicated, they use a slower, systematic approach (type 2 thinking). Both types of thinking interplay – they are not mutually exclusive in the diagnostic process.

					<ce:para id="p0615">Once all the available data from history, physical examination and (sometimes) initial test results are available, these need to be synthesised into a problem list. The ability to identify key clinical data and create a problem list is a key step in clinical reasoning. Some problems (e.g. low serum potassium) require action but not necessarily a differential diagnosis. Other problems (e.g. vomiting) require a differential diagnosis. The process of generating a problem list ensures nothing is missed. The process of generating a differential diagnosis works against anchoring on a particular diagnosis too early, thereby avoiding search satisficing and premature closure (see

ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure/examination) is probably the most successful checklist in medicine, used during the assessment and treatment of critically ill patients (ABCDE is sometimes prefixed with ‘C’ for ‘control of any obvious problem’; see

Considering and investigating for possible pulmonary embolism in patients who present with pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness is a common example of ruling out a worst-case scenario, as pulmonary embolism can be fatal if missed. Red flags and ROWS help to avoid cognitive biases such as the ‘framing effect’ and ‘premature closure’.

					<ce:para id="p0630">Newer strategies to avoid cognitive biases and errors in decision-making are emerging. These involve explicit training in clinical reasoning and human factors. In theory, if doctors are aware of the science of human thinking and decision-making, then they are more able to think about their thinking, understand situations in which their decision-making may be affected, and take steps to mitigate this.</ce:para>

				<ce:section-title id="st0115">Using clinical prediction rules and other decision aids</ce:section-title>
				<ce:para id="p0635">A clinical prediction rule is a statistical model of the diagnostic process. When clinical prediction rules are matched against the opinion of experts, the model usually outperforms the experts, because it is applied consistently in each case. However, it is important that clinical prediction rules are used correctly – that is, applied to the patient population that was used to create the rule. Clinical prediction rules force a scientific assessment of the patient's symptoms, signs and other data to develop a numerical probability of a disease or an outcome. They help clinicians to estimate probability more accurately.</ce:para>
				<ce:para id="p0640">A good example of a clinical prediction rule to estimate pre-test probability is the Wells score in suspected deep vein thrombosis (see 
					<ce:intra-ref id="ii0040" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00010-X#b0085">Box 10.15</ce:intra-ref>,

				<ce:para id="p0645">Effective team communication and proper handovers are vital for safe clinical care. The SBAR system of communication has been recommended by the UK's Patient Safety First campaign. It is a structured way to communicate about a patient with another health-care professional (e.g. during handover or when making a referral) and increases the amount of relevant information being communicated in a shorter time. It is illustrated in

			<ce:section-title id="st0125">Patient-centred evidence-based medicine and shared decision-making</ce:section-title>
			<ce:para id="p0665">‘Patient-centred evidence-based medicine’ refers to the application of best-available research evidence while taking individual patient factors into account; these include both clinical and non-clinical factors (e.g. the patient's social circumstances, values and wishes). For example, a 95-year-old man with dementia and a recent gastrointestinal bleed is admitted with an inferior myocardial infarction. He is clinically well. Should he be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and low-molecular-weight heparin as recommended in clinical guidelines?</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0670">As this chapter has described, clinicians frequently deal with uncertainty/probability. Clinicians need to be able to explain risks and benefits of treatment in an accurate and understandable way. Providing the relevant statistics is seldom sufficient to guide decision-making because a patient's perception of risk may be influenced by irrational factors as well as individual values.</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0675">Research evidence provides statistics but these can be confusing. Terms such as ‘common’ and ‘rare’ are nebulous. Whenever possible, clinicians should quote numerical information using consistent denominators (e.g. ‘90 out of 100 patients who have this operation feel much better, 1 will die during the operation and 2 will suffer a stroke’). Visual aids can be used to present complex statistical information (
				<ce:cross-ref id="crf0225" refid="f0050">Fig. 1.9</ce:cross-ref>
				<ce:float-anchor refid="f0050"/>).
			</ce:para>
			<ce:para id="p0680">How uncertainty is conveyed to patients is important. Many studies demonstrate a correlation between effective clinician–patient communication and improved health outcomes. If patients feel they have been listened to and understand the problem and proposed treatment plan, they are more likely to follow the plan and less likely to re-attend.</ce:para>

She reports that she had an upper respiratory tract infection a week ago and was almost back to normal when the symptoms started. The patient has no past medical history and no family history, and her only medication is the combined oral contraceptive pill.

Pleurisy and breathlessness are common presenting features of this disease but are also common presenting features in other diseases. There is nothing in the history to suggest an alternative diagnosis (e.g. high fever, productive cough, recent chest trauma). The patient's vital signs are normal, as is the physical examination. However, the only feature in the history and examination that has a negative likelihood ratio in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is a heart rate of less than 90 beats/min. In other words, the normal physical examination findings (including normal oxygen saturations) carry very little diagnostic weight.</ce:para>

This patient has no major risk factors for pulmonary embolism.

					<ce:para id="p0710">Imagine the patient went on to have a normal chest X-ray and blood results, apart from a raised D-dimer of 900 (normal &#x003C; 500 ng/mL). A normal chest X-ray is a common finding in pulmonary embolism. Several studies have shown that the D-dimer assay has at least 95% sensitivity in acute pulmonary embolism but it has a low specificity. A very sensitive test will detect most disease but generate abnormal findings in healthy people. On the other hand, a negative result virtually, but not completely, excludes the disease. It is important at this point to realise that a raised D-dimer result does not mean this patient has a pulmonary embolism; it just means that we have not been able to exclude it. Since pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal condition we need to rule out the worst-case scenario (ROWS), and the next step is therefore to arrange further imaging. What kind of imaging depends on individual patient characteristics and what is available.</ce:para>
