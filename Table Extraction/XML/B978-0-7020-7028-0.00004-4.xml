Phagocytes also recognise components of microbes, such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans, DNA and RNA, collectively as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors, which promote inflammatory gene expression through the nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκB) pathway. Uric acid and other crystals can also promote inflammation through the NOD pathway.</ce:simple-para>

Additional signals are required for T-cell activation, however. These include binding of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 with CD28 on the T cell, and interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is produced in an autocrine manner by T cells that are undergoing activation. Other molecules are present that can inhibit T-cell activation, however, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), which competes with CD28 for binding to CD80 and CD86; and PD1, which, by binding PDL1, is also inhibitory. Following activation, T cells proliferate and, depending on their subtype, have various functions with distinct patterns of cytokine production, as indicated. Memory cells are also generated that can mount a rapid immune response on encountering the same antigen.

		<ce:para id="p0140">The immune system has evolved to identify and destroy pathogens while minimising damage to host tissue. Despite the ancient observation that recovery from an infectious disease frequently results in protection against that condition, the existence of the immune system as a functional entity was not recognised until the end of the 19th century. More recently, it has become clear that the immune system not only protects against infection but also regulates tissue repair following injury, and when dysregulated, governs the responses that can lead to autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases. Dysfunction or deficiency of the immune response can lead to a wide variety of diseases that may potentially involve every organ system in the body.</ce:para>
		<ce:para id="p0145">The aim of this chapter is to provide a general understanding of the immune system, how it contributes to human disease and how manipulation of the immune system can be put to therapeutic use. A review of the key components of the immune response is followed by sections that illustrate the clinical presentation of the most common forms of immune dysfunction: immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity and allergy. More detailed discussion of individual conditions can be found in the relevant organ-specific chapters of this book.</ce:para>
		<ce:section id="s0010">
			<ce:section-title id="st0010">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title>
			<ce:para id="p0150">The immune system consists of an intricately linked network of lymphoid organs, cells and proteins that are strategically placed to protect against infection (
				<ce:cross-ref id="crf0140" refid="f0010">Fig. 4.1</ce:cross-ref>
				<ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>). Immune defences are normally categorised into the innate immune response, which provides immediate protection against an invading pathogen, and the adaptive or acquired immune response, which takes more time to develop but confers exquisite specificity and long-lasting protection.
			</ce:para>
			<ce:section id="s0015">
				<ce:section-title id="st0015">The innate immune system</ce:section-title>
				<ce:para id="p0155">Innate defences against infection include anatomical barriers, phagocytic cells, soluble molecules such as complement and acute phase proteins, and natural killer cells. The innate immune system recognises generic microbial structures present on non-mammalian tissue and can be mobilised within minutes. A specific stimulus will elicit essentially identical responses in different individuals, in contrast with adaptive antibody and T-cell responses, which vary greatly between individuals.</ce:para>
				<ce:section id="s0020">
					<ce:section-title id="st0020">Physical barriers</ce:section-title>
					<ce:para id="p0160">The tightly packed keratinised cells of the skin physically limit colonisation by microorganisms. The hydrophobic oils that are secreted by sebaceous glands further repel water and microorganisms, and microbial growth is inhibited by the skin's low pH and low oxygen tension. Sweat also contains lysozyme, an enzyme that destroys the structural integrity of bacterial cell walls; ammonia, which has antibacterial properties; and several antimicrobial peptides such as defensins. Similarly, the mucous membranes of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts provide a physical barrier to infection. Secreted mucus traps invading pathogens, and immunoglobulin A (IgA), generated by the adaptive immune system, prevents bacteria and viruses attaching to and penetrating epithelial cells. As in the skin, lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides within mucosal membranes directly kill invading pathogens, and lactoferrin acts to starve invading bacteria of iron. Within the respiratory tract, cilia directly trap pathogens and contribute to removal of mucus, assisted by physical manœuvres such as sneezing and coughing. In the gastrointestinal tract, hydrochloric acid and salivary amylase chemically destroy bacteria, while normal peristalsis and induced vomiting or diarrhoea assist clearance of invading organisms.</ce:para>
					<ce:para id="p0165">The microbiome, which is made up of endogenous commensal bacteria, provides an additional constitutive defence against infection. Approximately 10
						<ce:sup loc="post">14</ce:sup> bacteria normally reside at epithelial surfaces in symbiosis with the human host (
						<ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00006-8#s0090">p. 102</ce:intra-ref>). They compete with pathogenic microorganisms for scarce resources, including space and nutrients, and produce fatty acids and bactericidins that inhibit the growth of many pathogens. In addition, recent research has demonstrated that commensal bacteria help to shape the immune response by inducing specific regulatory T cells within the intestine. Eradication of the normal flora with broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly results in opportunistic infection by organisms such as 
						<ce:italic>Clostridium difficile</ce:italic>, which rapidly colonise an undefended ecological niche.
					</ce:para>
					<ce:para id="p0170">These constitutive barriers are highly effective, but if external defences are breached by a wound or pathogenic organism, the specific soluble proteins and cells of the innate immune system are activated.</ce:para>

				<ce:section id="s0025">
					<ce:section-title id="st0025">Phagocytes</ce:section-title>
					<ce:para id="p0175">Phagocytes (‘eating cells’) are specialised cells that ingest and kill microorganisms, scavenge cellular and infectious debris, and produce inflammatory molecules that regulate other components of the immune system. They include neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, and are particularly important for defence against bacterial and fungal infections. Phagocytes express a wide range of surface receptors, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on invading microorganisms, allowing their identification. The PRRs include Toll-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerisation domain (NOD) protein-like receptors and mannose receptors, whereas the PAMPs they recognise are molecular motifs not present on mammalian cells, including bacterial cell wall components, bacterial DNA and viral double-stranded RNA. While phagocytes can recognise microorganisms through PRRs alone, engulfment of microorganisms is greatly enhanced by opsonisation. Opsonins include acute phase proteins produced by the liver, such as C-reactive protein and complement. Antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system also act as opsonins. They bind both to the pathogen and to phagocyte receptors, acting as a bridge between the two to facilitate phagocytosis (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0145" refid="f0015">Fig. 4.2</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="f0015"/>). This is followed by intracellular pathogen destruction and downstream activation of pro-inflammatory genes, resulting in the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines as discussed below.
					</ce:para>
					<ce:section id="s0030">
						<ce:section-title id="st0030">Neutrophils</ce:section-title>
						<ce:para id="p0180">Neutrophils, also known as polymorphonuclear leucocytes, are derived from the bone marrow and circulate freely in the blood. They are short-lived cells with a half-life of 6 hours, and are produced at the rate of 10
							<ce:sup loc="post">11</ce:sup> cells daily. Their functions are to kill microorganisms, to facilitate rapid transit of cells through tissues, and to amplify the immune response non-specifically. These functions are mediated by enzymes contained in granules, which also provide an intracellular milieu for the killing and degradation of microorganisms.
						</ce:para>
						<ce:para id="p0185">Two main types of granule are recognised: primary or azurophil granules, and the more numerous secondary or specific granules. Primary granules contain myeloperoxidase and other enzymes important for intracellular killing and digestion of ingested microbes. Secondary granules are smaller and contain lysozyme, collagenase and lactoferrin, which can be released into the extracellular space. Enzyme production is increased in response to infection, which is reflected by more intense granule staining on microscopy, known as ‘toxic granulation’.</ce:para>
						<ce:para id="p0190">Changes in damaged or infected cells trigger local production of inflammatory molecules and cytokines. These cytokines stimulate the production and maturation of neutrophils in the bone marrow, and their release into the circulation. Neutrophils are recruited to specific sites of infection by chemotactic agents, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), and by activation of local endothelium. Up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules on neutrophils and the endothelium also facilitates neutrophil migration. The transit of neutrophils through the blood stream is responsible for the rise in neutrophil count that occurs in early infection. Once present within infected tissue, activated neutrophils seek out and engulf invading microorganisms. These are initially enclosed within membrane-bound vesicles, which fuse with cytoplasmic granules to form the phagolysosome. Within this protected compartment, killing of the organism occurs through a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative killing. Oxidative killing, also known as the respiratory burst, is mediated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)–oxidase enzyme complex, which converts oxygen into reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that are lethal to microorganisms. The myeloperoxidase enzyme within neutrophils produces hypochlorous acid, which is a powerful oxidant and antimicrobial agent. Non-oxidative (oxygen-independent) killing occurs through the release of bactericidal enzymes into the phagolysosome. Each enzyme has a distinct antimicrobial spectrum, providing broad coverage against bacteria and fungi.</ce:para>
						<ce:para id="p0195">An additional, recently identified form of neutrophil-mediated killing is neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Activated neutrophils can release chromatin with granule proteins such as elastase to form an extracellular matrix that binds to microbial proteins. This can immobilise or kill microorganisms without requiring phagocytosis. The process of phagocytosis and NET formation (NETosis) depletes neutrophil glycogen reserves and is followed by neutrophil death. As the cells die, their contents are released and lysosomal enzymes degrade collagen and other components of the interstitium, causing liquefaction of closely adjacent tissue. The accumulation of dead and dying neutrophils results in the formation of pus, which, if extensive, may lead to abscess formation.</ce:para>

From the blood stream they migrate to peripheral tissues, where they differentiate into tissue macrophages and reside for long periods. Specialised populations of tissue macrophages include Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lung, mesangial cells in the kidney, and microglial cells in the brain. Macrophages, like neutrophils, are capable of phagocytosis and killing of microorganisms but also play an important role in the amplification and regulation of the inflammatory response (

					<ce:para id="p0300">Cytokines are signalling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and a variety of other cell types. More than 100 have been identified. Cytokines have complex and overlapping roles in cellular communication and regulation of the immune response. Subtle differences in cytokine production, particularly at the initiation of an immune response, can have a major impact on outcome. Cytokines bind to specific receptors on target cells and activate downstream intracellular signalling pathways, ultimately leading to changes in gene transcription and cellular function. Two important signalling pathways are illustrated in 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0160" refid="f0020">Figure 4.3</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>. The nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway is activated by tumour necrosis factor (TNF), by other members of the TNF superfamily such as receptor activator of nuclear kappa B ligand (RANKL; 
						<ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#u0275">p. 985</ce:intra-ref>), and by the Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors (see 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0165" refid="f0015">Fig. 4.2</ce:cross-ref>). In the case of TNF superfamily members, receptor binding causes the inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) complex of three proteins to be recruited to the receptor by binding TNF receptor-associated proteins (TRAF). This activates IKK, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B protein (IκB), causing it to be degraded, and allowing NFκB to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is involved in transducing signals downstream of many cytokine receptors, including those for IL-2, IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). On receptor binding, JAK proteins are recruited to the intracellular portion of the receptor and are phosphorylated. These in turn phosphorylate STAT proteins, which translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription, altering cellular function. The function and disease associations of several important cytokines are shown in 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0170" refid="b0015">Box 4.2</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>. Cytokine inhibitors are now routinely used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, most of which are monoclonal antibodies to cytokines or their receptors. In addition, small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that inhibit the intracellular signalling pathways used by cytokines. These include the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib and baracitinib, which are used in rheumatoid arthritis (

The products of complement activation also help to target immune complexes to antigen-presenting cells, providing a link between the innate and the acquired immune systems.

They exhibit features of both the adaptive and the innate immune systems in that they are morphologically similar to lymphocytes and recognise similar ligands, but they are not antigen-specific and cannot generate immunological memory. NK cells express a variety of cell surface receptors, some of which are stimulatory and others inhibitory. The effects of inhibitory receptors normally predominate. These recognise human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules that are expressed on normal nucleated cells, preventing NK cell-mediated attack, whereas the stimulatory receptors recognise molecules that are expressed primarily when cells are damaged. This allows NK cells to remain tolerant to healthy cells but not to damaged ones. When cells become infected by viruses or undergo malignant change, expression of HLA class I molecules on the cell surface can be down-regulated. This is an important mechanism by which these cells then evade adaptive T-lymphocyte responses. In this circumstance, however, NK cell defences becomes important, as down-regulation of HLA class I abrogates the inhibitory signals that normally prevent NK activation. The net result is NK attack on the abnormal target cell. NK cells can also be activated by binding of antigen–antibody complexes to surface receptors. This physically links the NK cell to its target in a manner analogous to opsonisation and is known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</ce:para>

					<ce:para id="p0445">Humoral immunity is mediated by B lymphocytes, which differentiate from haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Their major functions are to produce antibody and interact with T cells, but they are also involved in antigen presentation. Mature B lymphocytes can be found in the bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, spleen and, to a lesser extent, the blood stream. They express a unique immunoglobulin receptor on their cell surface, the B-cell receptor, which binds to soluble antigen targets (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0205" refid="f0030">Fig. 4.5</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>). Encounters with antigen usually occur within lymph nodes. If provided with appropriate cytokines and other signals from nearby T lymphocytes, antigen-specific B cells respond by rapidly proliferating in a process known as clonal expansion (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf9025" refid="f0030">Fig. 4.5</ce:cross-ref>). This is accompanied by a highly complex series of genetic rearrangements known as somatic hypermutation, which generates B-cell populations that express receptors with greater affinity for antigen than the original. These cells differentiate into either long-lived memory cells, which reside in the lymph nodes, or plasma cells, which produce antibody. Memory cells allow production of a more rapid and more effective response on subsequent exposure to that pathogen.

						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0210" refid="f0035">Fig. 4.6</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="f0035"/>). The heavy chain determines the antibody class or isotype, such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE or IgD. Subclasses of IgG and IgA also occur. The antigen is recognised by the antigen-binding regions (F

						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0215" refid="b0020">Box 4.3</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/>). Antibodies have several functions. They facilitate phagocytosis by acting as opsonins (see 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0225" refid="f0015">Fig. 4.2</ce:cross-ref>) and facilitate cell killing by cytotoxic cells, particularly NK cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Binding of antibodies to antigen can trigger activation of the classical complement pathway (see 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0230" refid="f0025">Fig. 4.4</ce:cross-ref>). In addition, antibodies can directly neutralise the biological activity of their antigen target. This is a particularly important feature of IgA antibodies, which act predominantly at mucosal surfaces.
					</ce:para>
					<ce:para id="p0460">The humoral immune response is characterised by immunological memory, in which the antibody response to successive exposures to an antigen is qualitatively and quantitatively improved from the first exposure. When a previously unstimulated or ‘naïve’ B lymphocyte is activated by antigen, the first antibody to be produced is IgM, which appears in the serum after 5–10 days. Depending on additional stimuli provided by T lymphocytes, other antibody classes (IgG, IgA and IgE) are produced 1–2 weeks later. If the memory B cell is subsequently re-exposed to the same antigen, the lag time between exposure and production of antibody is decreased to 2–3 days, the amount of antibody produced is increased, and the response is dominated by IgG antibodies of high affinity. Furthermore, in contrast to the initial antibody response, secondary antibody responses do not require additional input from T lymphocytes. This allows the rapid generation of highly specific responses on re-exposure to a pathogen and is an important mechanism in vaccine efficacy.</ce:para>

					<ce:para id="p0465">Cellular immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes, which play important roles in defence against viruses, fungi and intracellular bacteria. They also play an important immunoregulatory role, by orchestrating and regulating the responses of other components of the immune system. T-lymphocyte precursors differentiate from haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and are exported to the thymus when they are still immature (see 
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0235" refid="f0010">Fig. 4.1</ce:cross-ref>). Individual T cells express a unique receptor that is highly specific for a single antigen. Within the thymus T cells undergo a process of stringent selection to ensure that autoreactive cells are destroyed. Mature T lymphocytes leave the thymus and expand to populate other organs of the immune system. It has been estimated that an individual possesses 10
						<ce:sup loc="post">7</ce:sup>–10

					</ce:para>
					<ce:para id="p0470">Unlike B cells, T cells cannot recognise intact protein antigens in their native form. Instead, the protein must be broken down into component peptides by antigen-presenting cells for presentation to T lymphocytes in association with HLA molecules on the antigen-presenting cell surface. This process is known as antigen processing and presentation, and it is the complex of peptide and HLA together that is recognised by individual T cells (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0240" refid="f0040">Fig. 4.7</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="f0040"/>). The structure of HLA molecules varies widely between individuals. Since each HLA molecule has the capacity to present a subtly different peptide repertoire to T lymphocytes, this ensures enormous diversity in recognition of antigens by the T-cell population. All nucleated cells have the capacity to process and present antigens, but cells with specialised antigen-presenting functions include dendritic cells, macrophages and B lymphocytes. These carry additional co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, providing the necessary ‘second signal’ for full T-cell activation.

					<ce:float-anchor refid="f0045"/>). The inflammatory process is initiated by local tissue injury or infection. Damaged epithelial cells produce cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, causing early infiltration of phagocytic cells. Production of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, histamine, kinins, anaphylotoxins and inducible nitric oxide synthase also occurs within inflamed tissue. These mediators cause vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability, causing trafficking of fluid and cells into the affected tissue. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-α and IL-6 produced at the site of injury, are released systemically and act on the hypothalamus to cause fever, and on the liver to stimulate production of acute phase proteins.

It is characterised by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, causing hypotension, hypovolaemia and tissue oedema. In addition, uncontrolled neutrophil activation causes release of proteases and oxygen free radicals within blood vessels, damaging the vascular endothelium and further increasing capillary permeability. Direct activation of the coagulation pathway combines with endothelial cell disruption to form clots within the damaged vessels. The clinical consequences include cardiovascular collapse, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure and often death. Septic shock most frequently results from infection with Gram-negative bacteria, because lipopolysaccharide produced by these organisms is particularly effective at activating the inflammatory cascade.

Normal tissue homeostasis is also associated with reversion of parenchymal cells to a non-inflammatory phenotype.

Leucocytosis is common, and reflects the transit of activated neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection. The platelet count may also be increased. The most widely used laboratory measure of acute inflammation is CRP. Circulating levels of many other acute phase reactants, including fibrinogen, ferritin and complement components, are also increased in response to acute inflammation, while albumin levels are reduced. Chronic inflammation is frequently associated with a normocytic normochromic anaemia (
					<ce:intra-ref id="ii0090" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#s0660">p. 943</ce:intra-ref>).

					<ce:para id="p0550">C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant synthesised by the liver, which opsonises invading pathogens. Circulating concentrations of CRP increase within 6 hours of the start of an inflammatory stimulus. Serum concentrations of CRP provide a direct biomarker of acute inflammation and, because the serum half-life of CRP is 18 hours, levels fall promptly once the inflammatory stimulus is removed. Sequential measurements are useful in monitoring disease activity (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0250" refid="b0025">Box 4.4</ce:cross-ref>
						<ce:float-anchor refid="b0025"/>). For reasons that remain unclear, some diseases are associated with only minor elevations of CRP despite unequivocal evidence of active inflammation. These include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and leukaemia. An important practical point is that if the CRP is raised in these conditions, it suggests intercurrent infection rather than disease activity. Since the CRP is a more sensitive early indicator of the acute phase response, it is generally used in preference to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). If both ESR and CRP are used, any discrepancy should be resolved by assessing the individual determinants of the ESR, which are discussed below.

					<ce:section-title id="st0190">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</ce:section-title>
					<ce:para id="p0560">The ESR is an indirect measure of inflammation. It measures how fast erythrocytes fall through plasma, which is determined by the composition of plasma proteins and the morphology of circulating erythrocytes. These factors govern the propensity of red cells to aggregate, the major determinant of the ESR. Erythrocytes are inherently negatively charged, which prevents them from clumping together in the blood stream. Since plasma proteins are positively charged, an increase in plasma protein concentrations neutralises the negative charge of erythrocytes, overcoming their inherent repulsive forces and causing them aggregate, resulting in rouleaux formation. Rouleaux have a higher mass-to-surface area ratio than single red cells, and therefore sediment faster. The most common reason for an increased ESR is an acute phase response, which causes an increase in the concentration of acute phase proteins, including CRP. However, other conditions that do not affect acute phase proteins may alter the composition and concentration of other plasma protein (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0265" refid="b0025">Box 4.4</ce:cross-ref>). For example, immunoglobulins comprise a significant proportion of plasma proteins but do not participate in the acute phase response. Thus any condition that causes an increase in serum immunoglobulins will increase the ESR without a corresponding increase in CRP. In addition, abnormal red cell morphology can make rouleaux formation impossible. For these reasons, an inappropriately low ESR occurs in spherocytosis and sickle-cell anaemia.

						<ce:para id="p1390">Autoimmune diseases result from the failure of immune tolerance, the process by which the immune system recognises and accepts self-tissue. Central immune tolerance occurs during lymphocyte development, when T and B lymphocytes that recognise self-antigens are eliminated before they develop into fully immunocompetent cells. This process is most active in fetal life but continues throughout life as immature lymphocytes are generated. Some autoreactive cells inevitably evade deletion and escape into the circulation, however, and are controlled through peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms include the suppression of autoreactive cells by regulatory T cells; the generation of functional hyporesponsiveness (anergy) in lymphocytes that encounter antigen in the absence of the co-stimulatory signals that accompany inflammation; and cell death by apoptosis. Autoimmune diseases develop when self-reactive lymphocytes escape from these tolerance mechanisms.</ce:para>
						<ce:para id="p1395">Multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases are much more common in women than in men, for reasons that remain unclear. Many are associated with genetic variations in the HLA loci, reflecting the importance of HLA genes in shaping lymphocyte responses. Other important susceptibility genes include those determining cytokine activity, co-stimulation (the expression of second signals required for full T-cell activation; see 
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0390" refid="f0040">Fig. 4.7</ce:cross-ref>) and cell death. Many of the same gene variants underlie multiple autoimmune disorders, reflecting their common pathogenesis (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0395" refid="b0100">Box 4.19</ce:cross-ref>
							<ce:float-anchor refid="b0100"/>). Even though some of these associations are the strongest that have been identified in complex genetic diseases, they have very limited predictive value and are generally not useful in determining management of individual patients. Several environmental factors may be associated with autoimmunity in genetically predisposed individuals, including infection, cigarette smoking and hormone levels. The most widely studied of these is infection, as occurs in acute rheumatic fever following streptococcal infection or reactive arthritis following bacterial infection. Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the autoimmunity that occurs after an infectious trigger. These include cross-reactivity between proteins expressed by the pathogen and the host (molecular mimicry), such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and 
							<ce:italic>Campylobacter</ce:italic> infection (
							<ce:intra-ref id="ii9010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s2070">p. 1140</ce:intra-ref>); release of sequestered antigens from tissues that are damaged during infections that are not usually visible to the immune system; and production of inflammatory cytokines that overwhelm the normal control mechanisms that prevent bystander damage. Occasionally, autoimmune disease may be an adverse effect of drug treatment. For example, metabolic products of the anaesthetic agent halothane can bind to liver enzymes, resulting in a structurally novel protein that is recognised as a foreign antigen by the immune system. This can provoke the development of autoantibodies and activated T cells, which can cause hepatic necrosis.

						<ce:para id="p1465">The immune system does not normally respond to the many environmental substances to which it is exposed on a daily basis. In allergic individuals, however, an initial exposure to a normally harmless exogenous substance (known as an allergen) triggers the production of specific IgE antibodies by activated B cells. These bind to high-affinity IgE receptors on the surface of mast cells, a step that is not itself associated with clinical sequelae. However, re-exposure to the allergen binds to and cross-links membrane-bound IgE, which activates the mast cells, releasing a variety of vasoactive mediators (the early phase response; 
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0420" refid="f0075">Fig. 4.14</ce:cross-ref>
							<ce:float-anchor refid="f0075"/> and see 
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0430" refid="b0050">Box 4.9</ce:cross-ref>). This type I hypersensitivity reaction forms the basis of an allergic reaction, which can range from sneezing and rhinorrhoea to anaphylaxis (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0435" refid="b0115">Box 4.22</ce:cross-ref>
							<ce:float-anchor refid="b0115"/>). In some individuals, the early phase response is followed by persistent activation of mast cells, manifest by ongoing swelling and local inflammation. This is known as the late phase reaction and is mediated by mast cell metabolites, basophils, eosinophils and macrophages. Long-standing or recurrent allergic inflammation may give rise to a chronic inflammatory response characterised by a complex infiltrate of macrophages, eosinophils and T lymphocytes, in addition to mast cells and basophils. Once this has been established, inhibition of mast cell mediators with antihistamines is clinically ineffective in isolation. Mast cell activation may also be non-specifically triggered through other signals, such as neuropeptides, anaphylotoxins and bacterial peptides.
						</ce:para>
						<ce:para id="p1530">The increasing incidence of allergic diseases is largely unexplained but one widely held theory is the ‘hygiene hypothesis’. This proposes that infections in early life are critically important in maturation of the immune response and bias the immune system against the development of allergies; the high prevalence of allergic disease is the penalty for the decreased exposure to infection that has resulted from improvements in sanitation and health care. Genetic factors also contribute strongly to the development of allergic diseases. A positive family history is common in patients with allergy, and genetic association studies have identified a wide variety of predisposing variants in genes controlling innate immune responses, cytokine production, IgE levels and the ability of the epithelial barrier to protect against environmental agents. The expression of a genetic predisposition is complex; it is governed by environmental factors, such as pollutants and cigarette smoke, and the incidence of bacterial and viral infection.</ce:para>

Even if organs were obtained from all potential cadaveric donors, though, their numbers would be insufficient to meet current needs. An alternative is the use of living donors. Altruistic living donation, usually from close relatives, is widely used in renal transplantation.

			<ce:para id="p1795">Surveillance by the immune system is critically important in monitoring and removing damaged and mutated cells as they arise. The ability of the immune system to kill cancer cells effectively is influenced by tumour immunogenicity and specificity. Many cancer antigens are poorly expressed and specific antigens can mutate, either spontaneously or in response to treatment, which can result in evasion of immune responses. In addition, the inhibitory pathways that are used to maintain self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during antimicrobial immune responses can be co-opted by cancerous cells to evade immune destruction. Recognition and understanding of these immune checkpoint pathways has led to the development of a number of new treatments for cancers that are otherwise refractory to treatment. For example, antibodies to CTLA4, a co-stimulatory molecule normally involved in down-regulation of immune responses, have been licensed for refractory melanoma, and antibodies to PD1 (programmed cell death protein 1) are used in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Potential risks include the development of autoimmunity, reflecting the importance of these pathways in the control of self-tolerance.</ce:para>
