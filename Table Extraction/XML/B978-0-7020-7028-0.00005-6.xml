This definition recognises that there is a collective responsibility for the health of the population that requires partnerships between government, health services and others to promote and protect health and prevent disease. Population health has been defined as ‘the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group’. Medical doctors can play a role in all these efforts to improve health both through their clinical work and through their support of broader actions to improve public health.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0010"><ce:section-title id="st0010">Global burden of disease and underlying risk factors</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0075">The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) exercise was initiated by the World Bank in 1992, with first estimates appearing in 1993. Regular updated figures have been published since, together with projections of future disease burden. The aim was to produce reliable and internally consistent estimates of disease burden for all diseases and injuries, and to assess their physiological, behavioural and social risk factors, so that this information could be made available to health workers, researchers and policy-makers.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0080">The GBD exercise adopted the metric ‘disability adjusted life year’ (DALY) to describe population health. This combines information about premature mortality in a population (measured as Years of Life Lost from an ‘expected’ life expectancy) and years of life lived with disability (Years of Life lived with Disability, which is weighted by a severity factor). The International Classification of Disease (ICD) rules, which assign one cause to each death, are followed. All estimates are presented by age and sex groups and by regions of the world. Many countries now also report their own national burden of disease data.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Life expectancy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0085">Global life expectancy at birth increased from 61.7 years in 1980 to 71.8 years in 2015, an increase of 0.29 years per calendar year. This change is due to a substantial fall in child mortality (mainly caused by common infections), partly offset by rises in mortality from adult conditions such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Some areas have not shown these increases in life expectancy in men, often due to war and interpersonal violence.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Global causes of death and disability</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0090"><ce:cross-ref id="crf0070" refid="b0010">Box 5.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/> shows a ranked list of the major causes of global premature deaths in 2015. Communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional causes accounted for about one-quarter of deaths worldwide, down from about one-third in 1990. In contrast, deaths from non-communicable diseases are increasing in importance and now account for about two-thirds of all deaths globally, including about 13 million from ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and about 8 million from cancer. The age-standardised death rates for most diseases globally are falling. However, despite this, the numbers of deaths from many diseases are rising due to global population growth and the change in age structure of the population to older ages, and this is placing an increasing burden on health systems. For a few conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease), age-standardised death rates continue to rise. Within this overall pattern, significant regional variations exist: for example, communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional causes still account for about two-thirds of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0180">GBD also provides estimates of disability from disease (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0090" refid="b0015">Box 5.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>). This has raised awareness of the importance of conditions like depression, low back and neck pain, and asthma, which account for a relatively large disease burden but relatively few deaths. This, in turn, has resulted in greater health policy priority being given to these conditions. Since the policy focus in national health systems is increasingly on keeping people healthy rather than only on reducing premature deaths, it is important to have measures of these health outcomes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0270">It is also essential to recognise that, although these estimates represent the best overall picture of burden of disease, they are based on imperfect data. Nevertheless, the quality of data underlying the estimates and the modelling processes are improving over time and provide an increasingly robust basis for evidence-based health planning and priority setting.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0025">Risk factors underlying disease</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0275"><ce:cross-ref id="crf0110" refid="b0020">Box 5.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/> shows a ranked list of the main risk factors that underlay GBD in 2015 and how this ranking has changed in recent years.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Social determinants of health</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0365">Health emerges from a highly complex interaction between a person's genetic background and environmental factors (aspects of the physical, biological (microbes), built and social environments, and also distant influences such as the global ecosystem; <ce:cross-ref id="crf0120" refid="f0010">Fig. 5.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0035">The hierarchy of systems – from molecules to ecologies</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0370">Influences on health exist at many levels and extend beyond the individual to include the family, community, population and ecology. <ce:cross-ref id="crf0125" refid="b0025">Box 5.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0025"/> shows an example of this for determinants of coronary heart disease and demonstrates the importance of considering not only the disease process in a patient but also its context.

Values and behaviours acquired during childhood and adolescence have a profound influence on educational outcomes, job prospects and risk of disease. These can have a strong influence, for example, on whether a young person takes up damaging behaviour like smoking, risky sexual activity and drug misuse. Influences on health can operate even before birth. Low birth weight can lead to higher risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes in young adults, and of cardiovascular disease in middle age. It has been suggested that under-nutrition during middle to late gestation permanently ‘programs’ cardiovascular and metabolic responses. This ‘life course’ perspective highlights the cumulative effect on health of exposures to illness, adverse environmental conditions and behaviours that damage health.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Preventive medicine</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0385">The complexity of interactions between physical, social and economic determinants of health means successful prevention is often difficult. Moreover, the life-course perspective illustrates that it may be necessary to intervene early in life or even before birth, to prevent important disease later. Successful prevention is likely to require many interventions across the life course and at several levels in the hierarchy of systems. The examples below illustrate this.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Alcohol</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0390">Alcohol use is an increasingly important risk factor underlying GBD (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0130" refid="b0020">Box 5.3</ce:cross-ref>). Reasons for increasing rates of alcohol-related harm vary by place and time but include the falling price of alcohol (in real terms), increased availability and cultural change fostering higher levels of consumption. Public, professional and governmental concern has now led to a minimum price being charged for a unit of alcohol, tightening of licensing regulations and curtailment of some promotional activity in many countries. However, even more aggressive public health measures will be needed to reverse the levels of harm in the population. The approach for individual patients suffering adverse effects of alcohol is described elsewhere (e.g. <ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00028-7#s0170">pp. 1184</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00022-6#p3245">880</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Smoking</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0395">Smoking is one of the top three risk factors underlying GBD (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0135" refid="b0020">Box 5.3</ce:cross-ref>).

Smoking also causes cancers of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, pancreas, bladder and kidney, and increases risks of peripheral vascular disease, stroke and peptic ulceration. Maternal smoking is an important cause of fetal growth retardation. Moreover, there is evidence that passive (‘second-hand’) smoking has adverse effects on cardiovascular and respiratory health.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0400">The decline in smoking in many high-income countries has been achieved not only by warning people of the health risks but also by increasing taxation of tobacco, banning advertising, legislating against smoking in public places and giving support for smoking cessation to maintain this decline. However, smoking rates remain high in many poorer areas and are increasing among young women. In many developing countries, tobacco companies have found new markets and rates are rising.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0405">A complex hierarchy of systems interacts to cause smokers to initiate and maintain their habit. At the molecular and cellular levels, nicotine acts on the nervous system to create dependence and maintain the smoking habit. There are also strong influences at the personal and social level, such as young female smokers being motivated to ‘stay thin’ or ‘look cool’ and peer pressure. Other important influences include cigarette advertising, with the advertising budget of the tobacco industry being much greater than that of health services. Strategies to help individuals stop smoking (such as nicotine replacement therapy, anti-smoking advice and behavioural support) are cost-effective and form an important part of the overall strategy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Obesity</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0410">Obesity is an increasingly important risk factor underlying GBD (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0140" refid="b0020">Box 5.3</ce:cross-ref>).

In the UK, this translates into a 1 kg increase in weight per adult per year (on average over the adult population). The current obesity epidemic cannot be explained simply by individual behaviour and poor choice but also requires an understanding of the obesogenic environment that encourages people to eat more and exercise less. This includes the availability of cheap and heavily marketed energy-rich foods, the increase in labour-saving devices (e.g. lifts and remote controls) and the rise in passive transport (cars as opposed to walking, cycling, or walking to public transport hubs). To combat the health impact of obesity, therefore, we not only need to help those who are already obese but also develop strategies that impact on the whole population and reverse the obesogenic environment.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section-title id="st0065">Poverty and affluence</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0415">The adverse health and social consequences of poverty are well documented: high birth rates, high death rates and short life expectancy.

Person-time is the sum of the total ‘exposed’ time for the population and in this example is 950 person-years. The reason person-time is less than 1000 is that 100 people experienced the event. These 100 people are assumed to have had an event, on average, halfway through the time period, removing 100 × 0.5 person-years from the exposure time (as it is not possible to have a first occurrence of a disease twice).

Allocation may not be truly random (e.g. because of inadequate concealment of the randomisation sequence), and there may be systematic differences (biases) in the way people allocated to different groups are treated or studied.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0620">Such biases also occur in observational epidemiological study designs, such as cohort, case–control and cross-sectional studies (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0165" refid="b0035">Box 5.6</ce:cross-ref>). These designs are also much more subject to the problem of confounding than are randomised trials.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0625">Confounding is where the relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest is confused by the presence of some other causal factor. For example, coffee consumption may be associated with lung cancer because smoking is more common among coffee-drinkers. Here, smoking is said to confound the association between coffee and lung cancer.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0630">Despite these limitations, for most causes of diseases, randomised controlled trials are not feasible because of ethical, or more often practical, considerations. Epidemiologists therefore seek to minimise bias and confounding by good study analysis and design. They subsequently make causal inferences by balancing the probability that an observed association has been caused by chance, bias and/or confounding against the alternative probability that the relationship is causal. This weighing-up requires an understanding of the frequency and importance of different sources of bias and confounding, as well as the scientific rationale of the putative causal relationship. It was this approach, collectively and over a number of years, that settled the fact that smoking causes lung cancer and, subsequently, heart disease.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0120"><ce:section-title id="st0120">Health data/informatics</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0635">As patients pass through health and social care systems, data are recorded concerning their family background, lifestyle and disease states, which is of potential interest to health-care organisations seeking to deliver services, policy-makers concerned with improving health, scientific researchers trying to understand health, and also pharmaceutical and other commercial organisations aiming to identify markets.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0640">There is a long tradition of maintaining health information systems. In most countries, registration of births and deaths is required by law, and in the majority, the cause of death is also recorded (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0170" refid="f0025">Fig. 5.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>).

Similar data are rarely collected for community-based health care, nor are detailed data on health-care processes generally included in national data systems. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in using data from information technology systems used to deliver care, such as electronic patient records, drug-dispensing databases, radiological software and clinical laboratory information systems.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0680">Data from such systems are, of course, much less structured than those obtained from vital registrations. Moreover, the completeness of such data depends greatly on local patterns of health-care utilisation, as well as how clinicians and others use information technology systems within different settings. As such, deriving useful, unbiased information from such data is a considerable challenge.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0685">Much of the discipline of health informatics is concerned with addressing this challenge. One approach has been to develop comprehensive standard classification systems such as SNOMED-CT, ‘a standardised, multilingual vocabulary of terms relating to the care of the individual’, which has been designed for electronic health-care records.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0690">An alternative has been to use statistical methods such as natural language processing to derive information automatically from free text (such as culling diagnoses from radiological reports), or to employ ‘machine learning’, in which software algorithms are applied to data in order to derive useful insights. Such approaches are suited to large, messy data where the costs of systematisation would be prohibitive. It is likely that such innovations will, over the coming years, provide useful information to complement that obtained from more traditional health information systems.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0125">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0010"><ce:section-title id="st0130">Books and journal articles</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib1"><ce:label>GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2016</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0010"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:surname>GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Lancet</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>388</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2016</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>1545</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>1602</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib2"><ce:label>GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2016</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0015"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:surname>GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Global, regional, and national life expectancy, and cause-specific mortalityfor 249 causes of death, 1980–2015: a systematic analysis forthe Global Burden of Disease Study 2015</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Lancet</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>388</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2016</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>1459</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>1544</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib3"><ce:label>GBD 2015 Risk Factors Collaborators, 2016</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0020"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:surname>GBD 2015 Risk Factors Collaborators</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Lancet</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>388</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2016</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>1659</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>1724</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib4"><ce:label>Kindig, Stoddart, 2003</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0025"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>D</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Kindig</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>G.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Stoddart</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>What is population health?</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Am J Public Health</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>93</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2003</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>380</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>383</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference></ce:further-reading-sec><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0015"><ce:section-title id="st0135">Websites</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib5"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0030"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0015" xlink:href="http://fph.org.uk" xlink:role="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/linking-roles/research-data">fph.org.uk</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib6"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0045"><ce:italic>UK Faculty of Public Health: What is publichealth?</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib7"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0035"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0020" xlink:href="http://gov.uk" xlink:role="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/linking-roles/research-data">gov.uk</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib8"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0050"><ce:italic>UK Government: population screeningprogrammes.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference></ce:further-reading-sec></ce:further-reading></chapter>
