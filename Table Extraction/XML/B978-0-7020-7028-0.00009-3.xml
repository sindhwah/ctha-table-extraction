While previously concerned mainly with controlling infectious diseases, the focus at present is predominantly on the multiple physical, chemical, biological and social factors that pose risks to human health. As the environment continually alters, whether through population growth, economic development or climate change, it plays an important role in disease causation – one that may increase over time. This chapter deals principally with acute effects of environmental hazards on individuals and should be read in conjunction with the chapters on Poisoning (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00007-X#c00007">Ch. 7</ce:intra-ref>) and Acute Medicine and Critical Illness (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00010-X#c00010">Ch. 10</ce:intra-ref>). <ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00005-6#c00005">Chapter 5</ce:intra-ref> deals with more general effects of environmental factors on population health.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0010"><ce:section-title id="st0010">Radiation exposure</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0040">Radiation includes ionising (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0035" refid="f0010">Fig. 9.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>) and non-ionising radiations (ultraviolet (UV), visible light, laser, infrared and microwave). While global industrialisation and the generation of fluorocarbons have raised concerns about loss of the ozone layer, leading to an increased exposure to UV rays, and disasters such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power station explosions have demonstrated the harm of ionising radiation, it is important to remember that it can be harnessed for medical benefit.

When they interact with atoms, energy is released and the resulting ionisation can lead to molecular damage.

To take account of different types of radiation and variations in the sensitivity of various tissues, weighting factors are used to produce a unit of effective dose, measured in sieverts (Sv). This value reflects the absorbed dose weighted for the damaging effects of a particular form of radiation and is most valuable in evaluating the long-term effects of exposure.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0055">‘Background radiation’ refers to our exposure to naturally occurring radioactivity (e.g. radon gas and cosmic radiation).

Tissues with actively dividing cells, such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal mucosa, are particularly sensitive to ionising radiation. Lymphocyte depletion is the most sensitive marker of bone marrow injury, and after exposure to a fatal dose, marrow aplasia is a common cause of death. However, gastrointestinal mucosal toxicity may cause earlier death due to profound diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and sepsis. The gonads are highly radiosensitive and radiation may result in temporary or permanent sterility. Eye exposure can lead to cataracts and the skin is susceptible to radiation burns. Irradiation of the lung may induce acute inflammatory reactions or pulmonary fibrosis, and irradiation of the central nervous system may cause permanent neurological deficit. Bone necrosis and lymphatic fibrosis are characteristic following regional irradiation, particularly for breast cancer. The thyroid gland is not inherently sensitive but its ability to concentrate iodine makes it susceptible to damage after exposure to relatively low doses of radioactive iodine isotopes, such as those released from Chernobyl.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Stochastic effects</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0070">Stochastic (chance) effects occur with increasing probability as the dose of radiation increases. Carcinogenesis represents a stochastic effect. With acute exposures, leukaemias may arise after an interval of around 2–5 years and solid tumours after an interval of about 10–20 years. Thereafter the incidence rises with time. An individual's risk of developing cancer depends on the dose received, the time to accumulate the total dose and the interval following exposure.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Management of radiation exposure</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0075">Exposed people should be removed from ongoing exposure (‘get inside, stay inside’), and should take off affected clothing and shower to stop further contamination. If contamination of food and water supplies may have occurred, only bottled water and food in sealed containers should be consumed. The principal problems after large-dose exposures are maintenance of adequate hydration, control of sepsis and management of marrow aplasia. Associated injuries such as thermal burns need specialist management within 48 hours of active resuscitation. Internal exposure to radioisotopes should be treated with chelating agents (such as Prussian blue used to chelate <ce:sup loc="post">137</ce:sup>caesium after ingestion).

Body temperature is controlled in the hypothalamus, which is directly sensitive to changes in core temperature and indirectly responds to temperature-sensitive neurons in the skin. The normal ‘set-point’ of core temperature is tightly regulated within the range 37 ± 0.5°C, which is necessary to preserve the normal function of many enzymes and other metabolic processes. The temperature set-point is increased in response to infection (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0025" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00011-1#s0115">p. 218</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0090">In a cold environment, protective mechanisms include cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering; however, any muscle activity that involves movement may promote heat loss by increasing convective loss from the skin, and respiratory heat loss by stimulating ventilation.

Hypothyroidism is often a contributory factor in old age, while alcohol and other drugs (e.g. phenothiazines) commonly impede the thermoregulatory response in younger people. More rarely, hypothermia is secondary to hypothyroidism, glucocorticoid insufficiency, stroke, hepatic failure or hypoglycaemia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0130">Hypothermia also occurs in healthy individuals whose thermoregulatory mechanisms are intact but insufficient to cope with the intensity of the thermal stress. Typical examples include immersion in cold water, when core temperature may fall rapidly (acute hypothermia), exposure to extreme climates such as during hill walking (subacute hypothermia), and slow-onset hypothermia, as develops in an immobilised older individual (subchronic hypothermia).

Oxygen tension within the pulmonary alveoli is further reduced at altitude because the partial pressure of water vapour is related to body temperature and not barometric pressure, and so is proportionately greater at altitude, accounting for only 6% of barometric pressure at sea level but 19% at 8848 m.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0145"><ce:section id="s0150"><ce:section-title id="st0135">Physiological effects of high altitude</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0275">Reduction in oxygen tension results in a fall in arterial oxygen saturation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0110" refid="f0030">Fig. 9.5</ce:cross-ref>).

Nitrogen is a weak anaesthetic agent, and if the inspiratory pressure of nitrogen is allowed to increase above 320 kPa (3.2 ata; i.e. a depth of approximately 30 msw), it produces ‘narcosis’, resulting in impairment of cognitive function and manual dexterity, not unlike alcohol intoxication.

This must all occur during the emergency phase and is followed by the implementation of a public health surveillance and reporting system and the mobilisation of local human resources, and their training and deployment during the consolidation phase in order to prepare for handover to the local competent authority and withdrawal.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0275">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0010"><ce:section-title id="st0280">Websites</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib1"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0010"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0010" xlink:href="http://altitude.org">altitude.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib2"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0055"><ce:italic>A website written by doctors with expertise and experience of expedition and altitude medicine and critical care.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib3"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0015"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0015" xlink:href="http://diversalertnetwork.org">diversalertnetwork.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib4"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0060"><ce:italic>Advice on the clinical management of diving illness and emergency assistance services.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib5"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0020"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0020" xlink:href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/">emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib6"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0065"><ce:italic>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information and links on all forms of radiation for patients and professionals.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib7"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0025"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0025" xlink:href="http://msf.org">msf.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib8"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0070"><ce:italic>Information and advice about all aspects of responding to humanitarian crises around the world.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference></ce:further-reading-sec></ce:further-reading><ce:section id="s0300"><ce:section-title id="st0285">Telephone numbers</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0685">Two organisations can offer national and international advice on diving emergencies and recompression facilities:<ce:list id="ulist0100"><ce:list-item id="u0280"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0690">Within the UK, the National Diving Accident Helpline on +44 (0)7831 151523 (24 hours).</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0285"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0695">Outside the UK, contact the Divers Alert Network International Emergency Hotline +1-919-684-9111.</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para></ce:section></chapter>
