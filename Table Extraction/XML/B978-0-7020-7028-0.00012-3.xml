case of HIV infection has been traced to a blood sample from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which progressively impairs cellular immunity. The origin of HIV is a zoonotic infection with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) from African primates, probably first infecting local hunters. SIVs do not cause disease in their natural primate hosts. HIV-1 was transmitted from chimpanzees and HIV-2 from sooty mangabey monkeys. HIV-1 is the cause of the global HIV pandemic, while HIV-2, which causes a similar illness to HIV-1 but progresses more slowly and is less transmissible, is restricted mainly to western Africa. It has been estimated that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 first infected humans about 100 years ago. HIV-2 will not be discussed further in this chapter.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0175">There are three groups of HIV-1, representing three separate transmission events from chimpanzees: M (‘major’, worldwide distribution), O (‘outlier’) and N (‘non-major and non-outlier’). Groups O and N are restricted to West Africa. Group M consists of nine subtypes: A–D, F–H, J and K (subtypes E and I were subsequently shown to be recombinants of other subtypes). Globally, subtype C (which predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and India) accounts for half of infections and appears to be more readily transmitted. Subtype B predominates in Western Europe, the Americas and Australia. In Europe, the prevalence of non-B subtypes is increasing because of migration. Subtypes A and D are associated with slower and faster disease progression, respectively.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Global and regional epidemics</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0180">In 2015 it was estimated that there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS, 2.1 million new infections and 1.1 million AIDS-related deaths. The global epidemiology of HIV has been changed by expanding access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), which reached 17 million people in 2015: the annual number of AIDS-related deaths has almost halved since the peak in 2005, the number of new infections has decreased by 40% since the peak in 1997, and the number of people living with HIV has increased. Regions have marked differences in HIV prevalence, incidence and dominant modes of transmission (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0175" refid="b0015">Box 12.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>).

Worldwide, the major route of transmission is heterosexual. The risk of contracting HIV after exposure to infected body fluid is dependent on the integrity of the exposed site, the type and volume of fluid, and the level of viraemia in the source person. The approximate transmission risk after exposure is given in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0180" refid="b0020">Box 12.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/>.

Entry into the cell commences with binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0190" refid="f0015">Fig. 12.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0015"/>), which results in a conformational change in gp120 that permits binding to one of two chemokine co-receptors (CXCR4 or CCR5). The chemokine co-receptor CCR5 is utilised during initial infection, but later on the virus may adapt to use CXCR4. Individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5 delta 32 mutation do not express CCR5 on CD4 cells and are immune to HIV infection. Chemokine co-receptor binding is followed by membrane fusion and cellular entry involving gp41. After penetrating the cell and uncoating, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy is transcribed from the RNA genome by the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is carried by the infecting virion. Reverse transcription is an error-prone process and multiple mutations arise with ongoing replication, which results in considerable viral genetic heterogeneity. Viral DNA is transported into the nucleus and integrated within the host cell genome by the integrase enzyme. Integrated virus is known as proviral DNA and persists for the life of the cell. Cells infected with proviral HIV DNA produce new virions only if they undergo cellular activation, resulting in the transcription of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) copies, which are then translated into viral peptide chains. The precursor polyproteins are then cleaved by the viral protease enzyme to form new viral structural proteins and enzymes that migrate to the cell surface and are assembled using the host cellular apparatus to produce infectious viral particles; these bud from the cell surface, incorporating the host cell membrane into the viral envelope. The mature virion then infects other CD4 cells and the process is repeated. CD4 lymphocytes that are replicating HIV have a very short survival time of about 1 day. It has been estimated that in asymptomatic HIV-infected people, more than 10<ce:sup loc="post">10</ce:sup> virions are produced and 10<ce:sup loc="post">9</ce:sup> CD4 lymphocytes destroyed each day. The CD4 lymphocytes are destroyed primarily by the host immune response rather than by cytopathic effects of HIV.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0315">A small percentage of T-helper lymphocytes enter a post-integration latent phase. Latently infected cells are important as sanctuary sites from antiretroviral drugs, which act only on replicating virus. Current ART is unable to eradicate HIV infection due to the persistence of proviral DNA in long-lived latent CD4 cells.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0320">The host immune response to HIV infection is both humoral, with the development of antibodies to a wide range of antigens, and cellular, with a dramatic expansion of HIV-specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes, resulting in a CD8 lymphocytosis and reversal of the usual CD4:CD8 ratio. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill activated CD4 cells that are replicating HIV, but not latently infected CD4 cells. HIV evades destruction despite this vigorous immune response, in part because the highly conserved regions of gp120 and gp41 that are necessary for viral attachment and entry are covered by highly variable glycoprotein loops that change over time as a result of mutations selected for by the immune response. The initial peak of viraemia in primary infection settles to a plateau phase of persistent chronic viraemia. With time, there is gradual attrition of the T-helper lymphocyte population and, as these cells are pivotal in orchestrating the immune response, the patient becomes susceptible to opportunistic diseases. The predominant opportunist infections in HIV-infected people are the consequences of impaired cell-mediated rather than antibody-mediated immunity (e.g. mycobacteria, herpesviruses). However, there is also a B-lymphocyte defect with impaired antibody production to new antigens and dysregulated antibody production with a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins, resulting in an increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria, notably <ce:italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</ce:italic>.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0325">The immune activation in response to HIV infection does not completely resolve on effective ART.

HIV is diagnosed by detecting host antibodies either with rapid point-of-care tests or in the laboratory, where enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests are usually done. Most tests detect antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2. A positive antibody test from two different immunoassays is sufficient to confirm infection. Western blot assays can also be used to confirm infection but they are expensive and sometimes yield indeterminate results. Screening tests often include an assay for p24 antigen in addition to antibodies, in order to detect patients with primary infection before the antibody response occurs. Nucleic acid amplification tests (usually polymerase chain reaction, PCR) to detect HIV RNA are used to diagnose infections in infants of HIV-infected mothers, who carry maternal antibodies to HIV for up to 15 months irrespective of whether they are infected, and to diagnose primary infection before antibodies have developed.

In both, patients are staged according to the most severe manifestation and do not improve their classification.

Symmetrical generalised lymphadenopathy may occur in disseminated tuberculosis. Lymphoma typically presents with large, firm, asymmetric nodes. Rapid enlargement of a node, asymmetric enlargement or lymphadenopathy associated with constitutional symptoms (even if the nodes are symmetrical) warrants further investigation. Lymph node needle aspiration (using a wide-bore needle such as 19G if tuberculosis is suspected) should be performed. One slide should be air-dried and sent for staining for acid-fast bacilli, which has about a 70% yield in tuberculosis. The other slide should be fixed and sent for cytology.

It is possible to construct effective regimens without NRTIs if there is intolerance or resistance to the NRTIs. Currently used PIs should always be administered with ritonavir, which itself is a PI that is toxic in therapeutic doses. Low doses of ritonavir dramatically increase the concentrations and elimination half-lives of other PIs by inhibiting the efflux pump P-glycoprotein and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1650">Most guidelines from high-income countries, including the UK, allow clinicians to choose a starting regimen of dual NRTIs combined with an NNRTI, or a PI or an integrase inhibitor, as these three regimens have similar efficacy. Subsequent ART regimen switches for virological failure are guided by the results of resistance testing (see below). For low- and middle-income countries, the WHO recommends a public health approach to using ART with standardised first-line (NNRTI plus dual NRTIs) and second-line (ritonavir-boosted PI plus dual NRTIs) regimens. NNRTIs are preferred by the WHO in first-line regimens, as they are cheaper than PIs and better tolerated. Furthermore, NNRTIs need to be given with two fully active NRTIs because they have a low genetic barrier to resistance (see below), whereas PI-containing regimens are effective even when there are some mutations conferring resistance to the NRTIs. PIs in second-line regimens are therefore preferable in settings where resistance testing is not widely available. The public health approach to using ART can be implemented by nurses and has been successfully applied in resource-poor settings.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0470"><ce:section-title id="st0460">Criteria for starting ART</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1655">Guidelines now recommend starting ART in all people with confirmed HIV infection, irrespective of CD4 count or clinical status. Early initiation of ART, compared with the previous strategy of deferring ART until CD4 thresholds or clinical disease occurs, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality, and has the additional benefit of reducing the risk of transmission.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1660">It is seldom necessary to start ART urgently. Several consultations are required to give patients insight into the need for life-long ART, to stress the importance of adherence and to formulate a personal treatment plan. Disclosure of HIV status, joining support groups and using patient-nominated treatment supporters should be encouraged, as these have been shown to improve adherence. Recognition and management of depression and substance abuse is also important.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1665">In patients with major opportunistic infections, ART should generally be started within 2 weeks, with two important exceptions: in cryptococcal meningitis, ART should be deferred for 5 weeks, as earlier initiation increases the risk of death; and in tuberculosis, ART should be deferred until 8 weeks (except if the CD4 count is &#x003C; 50 cells/mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup>), as earlier initiation increases the risk of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (see below).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0475"><ce:section-title id="st0465">Monitoring efficacy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1670">The most important measure of ART efficacy is the viral load. A baseline viral load should be measured prior to initiating treatment. Viral load measurement should be repeated 4 weeks after starting ART, when there should be at least a 10-fold decrease. The viral load should be suppressed after 6 months. Once the viral load is suppressed, measurement should be repeated 6-monthly. Failure of ART is defined by the viral load becoming detectable after suppression. In most guidelines, a viral load threshold is used to define virological failure, e.g. more than 200 (UK) or more than 1000 (WHO) copies/mL. Adherence support should be enhanced if virological failure is detected, and measurement of the viral load repeated to confirm failure before switching to a new ART regimen.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1675">CD4 counts are generally monitored every 6 months together with the viral load, but there is little point in repeating the CD4 count in patients who maintain virological suppression and whose CD4 count is &#x003E; 350 cells/mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup>. The CD4 count increases rapidly in the first month, followed by a more gradual increase. In the first year, the CD4 count typically increases by 100–150 cells/mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup>, and about 80 cells/mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup> per annum thereafter until the reference range is reached, provided the viral load is suppressed. However, CD4 responses are highly variable: in about 15–30% of patients the CD4 count does not increase despite virological suppression, and in a similar proportion of patients the CD4 response is good despite the presence of virological failure. If ART is stopped, the CD4 count rapidly falls to the baseline value before ART was commenced.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0480"><ce:section-title id="st0470">Antiretroviral resistance</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1680">Reverse transcription is error-prone, generating a large number of mutations. If the viral load is suppressed on ART, viral replication is suppressed and resistance mutations will not be selected. If ART is taken and there is ongoing replication, due to either resistant mutations or suboptimal adherence, mutations conferring resistance to antiretroviral drugs will be selected. Antiretroviral drugs differ in their ability to select for resistant mutations. Some drugs (e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz) have a low genetic barrier to resistance, rapidly selecting for a single mutation conferring high-level resistance. PIs and some NRTIs (e.g. zidovudine) select for resistance mutations slowly, and multiple resistant mutations often need to accumulate before the drug's efficacy is lost. Patients who develop antiretroviral resistance may transmit resistant virus to others and will eventually develop clinical failure.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1685">Antiretroviral resistance is assessed by sequencing the relevant viral genes to detect mutations that are known to confer resistance. The patient must be taking ART when the test is performed, as otherwise the wild-type virus will predominate and resistant mutations will not be detected. The resistant proviral DNA is archived in latent CD4 cells and will re-emerge rapidly on re-exposure to the antiretroviral. In regions where resistance testing is affordable, it is recommended at baseline (to detect primary resistance) and at every confirmed virological failure, in order to select the most appropriate antiretrovirals in a new regimen.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0485"><ce:section-title id="st0475">ART complications</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0490"><ce:section-title id="st0480">Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1690">Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a common early complication of ART, especially in patients who start ART with CD4 counts below 50 cells/mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup>. IRIS presents either with paradoxical deterioration of an existing opportunistic disease (including infections that are responding to appropriate therapy) or with the unmasking of a new infection. The clinical presentation of IRIS events is often characterised by an exaggerated immune response, with pronounced inflammatory features. For example, patients with CMV retinitis developing IRIS on ART develop a uveitis; inflammatory haloes occur around KS lesions. Paradoxical tuberculosis IRIS events are common but it is important to exclude multidrug resistance, which could be responsible for the deterioration. IRIS is associated with a mortality of around 5% but this is higher when it complicates CNS infections.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1695">The management of IRIS is to continue ART and to ensure that the opportunistic disease is adequately treated. Symptomatic treatments are helpful. Glucocorticoids are often used for more severe IRIS manifestations but they should not be given to patients with KS, as this can result in rapid progression of KS lesions.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0495"><ce:section-title id="st0485">Lipodystrophy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1700"><ce:display><ce:textbox id="b0100" role="alt2"><ce:label><ce:inline-figure baseline="0.0"><ce:link id="ln0180" locator="icon02-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000123/icon02-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/><ce:alt-text id="atte0340" role="short">Image 20</ce:alt-text></ce:inline-figure>12.18</ce:label><ce:alt-text id="atte0345" role="short">12.18</ce:alt-text><ce:textbox-head><ce:title id="tit0105">HIV infection in old age</ce:title></ce:textbox-head><ce:textbox-body><ce:sections><ce:para id="p1705"><ce:list id="ulist0250"><ce:list-item id="u0935"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p1710"><ce:bold>Epidemiology</ce:bold>: the HIV-infected population is ageing due to the life-prolonging effects of ART.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0940"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p1715"><ce:bold>Immunity</ce:bold>: age-related decline increases the risk of infections.

The thymidine analogue NRTIs (stavudine and, to a lesser extent, zidovudine) are associated with fat loss.

However, recent studies have shown that all classes of antiretrovirals are associated with fat gain to a similar extent, and visceral adiposity is similar to that seen in the general population.

The NRTI abacavir typically causes a systemic hypersensitivity reaction, which is limited to people with HLA-B*5701, about 50% of whom will develop a hypersensitivity reaction. HLA testing should be done before abacavir is given and the drug should not be prescribed for people who are HLA-B*5701-positive, which is rare in people of African descent. Rechallenge must never be attempted after abacavir hypersensitivity, as fatal reactions may occur.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1745">Drug rashes are very common with NNRTIs.

The CD4 count falls by about 25% during pregnancy due to haemodilution. The course of HIV disease progression is not altered by pregnancy. In the pre-ART era, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 15–40%, with rates being influenced by several factors (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0445" refid="b0025">Box 12.3</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p1760">ART has dramatically reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 1%.

In high-income countries, exclusive formula feeding is generally recommended. In resource-poor settings, however, formula feeding is associated with a risk of infant morbidity and mortality, which may negate the benefit of not transmitting HIV to the infant. There is minimal risk of transmitting HIV by breastfeeding in women with a suppressed viral load on ART. Furthermore, providing antiretrovirals to infants (usually nevirapine monotherapy) while they are breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission. Breastfeeding is therefore now encouraged in resource-poor settings. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, as mixed feeding (with formula or solids) is associated with a higher risk of transmission.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1775">Diagnosis of HIV in infancy requires the detection of HIV RNA by PCR, as maternal antibodies to HIV, which persist for up to 15 months, will give a false-positive result on antibody assays. PCR should ideally be carried out within 6 weeks of birth to facilitate early ART initiation.
