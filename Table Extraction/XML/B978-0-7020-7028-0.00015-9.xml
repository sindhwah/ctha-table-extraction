Over-diuresis risks secondary impairment of renal function through

Disorders of renal tubular function, which may cause alterations in electrolyte and acid–base balance, are described in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#c00014">Chapter 14</ce:intra-ref>.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0020">The kidneys</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0305">The kidneys play a central role in excretion of many metabolic breakdown products, including ammonia and urea from protein, creatinine from muscle, uric acid from nucleic acids, drugs and toxins. They achieve this by making large volumes of an ultrafiltrate of plasma (120 mL/min, 170 L/24 hrs) at the glomerulus, and selectively reabsorbing components of this ultrafiltrate at points along the nephron. The rates of filtration and reabsorption are controlled by many hormonal and haemodynamic signals to regulate fluid and electrolyte balance (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#s0050">p. 349</ce:intra-ref>), blood pressure (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00016-0#p0510">p. 447</ce:intra-ref>), and acid–base (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0025" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#p1980">p. 363</ce:intra-ref>) and calcium–phosphate homeostasis (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0030" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#p2365">pp. 367 and 368</ce:intra-ref>). In addition, the kidneys activate vitamin D and control the synthesis of red blood cells by producing erythropoietin. Strategies to replace each of these important functions are required when managing patients with kidney failure.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0310">Each kidney is approximately 11–14 cm in length in healthy adults; they are located retroperitoneally on either side of the aorta and inferior vena cava between the 12th thoracic and 3rd lumbar vertebrae (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0295" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1A</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>). The right kidney is usually a few centimetres lower because the liver lies above it. Both kidneys rise and descend several centimetres with respiration.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0315">The kidneys have a rich blood supply and receive approximately 20–25% of cardiac output through the renal arteries, which arise from the abdominal aorta. The renal arteries undergo various subdivisions within the kidney, eventually forming interlobular arteries that run through the renal cortex. These eventually give rise to afferent glomerular arterioles that supply the glomeruli. The efferent arteriole, leading from the glomerulus, supplies the distal nephron and medulla in a ‘portal’ circulation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0300" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1B</ce:cross-ref>). This highly unusual arrangement of two serial capillary beds reflects the role of the afferent and efferent arterioles in autoregulation of glomerular filtration.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0025">The nephron</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0320">Each kidney contains approximately 1 million individual functional units, called nephrons. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus, which is responsible for ultrafiltration of blood, a proximal renal tubule, a loop of Henle, a distal renal tubule and a collecting duct, which together are responsible for selective reabsorption of water and electrolytes that have been filtered at the glomerulus (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0050" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#f0025">Fig. 14.2</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0055" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#s0065">p. 350</ce:intra-ref>, and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0305" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1B</ce:cross-ref>). Under normal circumstances, more than 99% of the 170 L of glomerular filtrate that is produced each day is reabsorbed in the tubules. The remainder passes through the collecting ducts of multiple nephrons and drains into the renal pelvis and ureters.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0030">The glomerulus</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0325">The glomerulus comprises a tightly packed loop of capillaries supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole. It is surrounded by a cup-shaped extension of the proximal tubule termed Bowman's capsule, which is composed of epithelial cells. The glomerular capillary endothelial cells contain pores (fenestrae), through which circulating molecules can pass to reach the underlying glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which is formed by fusion of the basement membranes of tubular epithelial and vascular endothelial cells (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0310" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1C and D</ce:cross-ref>). Glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) have multiple long foot processes that interdigitate with those of the adjacent epithelial cells, thereby maintaining a selective barrier to filtration (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0315" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1E</ce:cross-ref>). Mesangial cells lie in the central region of the glomerulus. They have contractile properties similar to those of vascular smooth muscle cells and play a role in regulating glomerular filtration rate.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0330">Under normal circumstances, the glomerulus is impermeable to proteins the size of albumin (67 kDa) or larger, while proteins of 20 kDa or smaller are filtered freely. The ability of molecules between 20 and 67 kDa to pass through the GBM is variable and depends on the size (smaller molecules are filtered more easily) and charge (positively charged molecules are filtered more easily). Very little lipid is filtered by the glomerulus.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0335">Filtration pressure at the glomerulus is normally maintained at a constant level, in the face of wide variations in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, by alterations in muscle tone within the afferent and efferent arterioles and mesangial cells. This is known as autoregulation. Reduced renal perfusion pressure increases local production of prostaglandins that mediate vasodilatation of the afferent arteriole, thereby increasing the intraglomerular pressure (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0320" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1D</ce:cross-ref>). In addition, renin is released by specialised smooth muscle cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus in response to reduced perfusion pressure, stimulation of sympathetic nerves or low sodium concentration of fluid in the distal convoluted tubule at the macula densa. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to release angiotensin I, which is further cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce angiotensin II. This restores glomerular perfusion pressure in the short term by causing vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles within the kidney to raise intraglomerular pressure selectively (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0325" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1D</ce:cross-ref>), and by inducing systemic vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure and thus renal perfusion pressure. In the longer term, angiotensin II increases plasma volume by stimulating aldosterone release, which enhances sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0060" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#f0115">Fig. 18.18</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0065" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0930">p. 666</ce:intra-ref>). Consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations and renin–angiotensin system inhibitors in the context of volume depletion may impair the ability of the kidney to maintain glomerular filtration and exacerbate pre-renal failure (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf10050" refid="f0115">Fig. 15.19</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf10065" refid="s0700">p. 413</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Renal tubules, loop of Henle and collecting ducts</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0340">The proximal renal tubule, loop of Henle, distal renal tubule and collecting ducts are responsible for reabsorption of water, electrolytes and other solutes, as well as regulating acid–base balance, as described in detail on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0075" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#s0065">page 350</ce:intra-ref> and in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0080" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#f0030">Figure 14.3</ce:intra-ref>. They also play a key role in regulating calcium homeostasis by converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0085" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#s9005">p. 1049</ce:intra-ref>). Failure of this process contributes to the pathogenesis of hypocalcaemia and bone disease that occurs in chronic kidney disease (CKD, <ce:cross-ref id="crf10070" refid="s0760">p. 415</ce:cross-ref>). Fibroblast-like cells that lie in the interstitium of the renal cortex are responsible for production of erythropoietin, which in turn is required for production of red blood cells. Erythropoietin synthesis is regulated by oxygen tension; anaemia and hypoxia increase production, whereas polycythaemia and hyperoxia inhibit it. Failure of erythropoietin production plays an important role in the pathogenesis of anaemia in CKD.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0040">The ureters and bladder</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0345">The ureters drain urine from the renal pelvis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0330" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1A</ce:cross-ref>) and deliver it to the bladder, a muscular organ that lies anteriorly in the lower part of the pelvis, just behind the pubic bone. The function of the bladder is to store and then release urine during micturition. The bladder is richly innervated. Sympathetic nerves arising from T10–L2 relay in the pelvic ganglia to cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the bladder neck (both via α-adrenoceptors), thereby preventing release of urine from the bladder. The distal sphincter mechanism is innervated by somatic motor fibres from sacral segments S2–4, which reach the sphincter either by the pelvic plexus or via the pudendal nerves. Afferent sensory impulses pass to the cerebral cortex, from where reflex-increased sphincter tone and suppression of detrusor contraction inhibit micturition until it is appropriate. Conversely, parasympathetic nerves arising from S2–4 stimulate detrusor contraction, promoting micturition.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0350">The micturition cycle has a storage (filling) phase and a voiding (micturition) phase. During the filling phase, the high compliance of the detrusor muscle allows the bladder to fill steadily without a rise in intravesical pressure. As bladder volume increases, stretch receptors in its wall cause reflex bladder relaxation and increased sphincter tone. The act of micturition is initiated first by voluntary and then by reflex relaxation of the pelvic floor and distal sphincter mechanism, followed by reflex detrusor contraction. These actions are coordinated by the pontine micturition centre. Intravesical pressure remains greater than urethral pressure until the bladder is empty.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0045">The prostate gland</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0355">The prostate gland is situated at the base of the bladder, surrounding the proximal urethra (<ce:cross-ref id="crf10075" refid="f0015">p. 383</ce:cross-ref>). Exocrine glands within the prostate produce fluid, which comprises about 20% of the volume of ejaculated seminal fluid and is rich in zinc and proteolytic enzymes. The remainder of the ejaculate is formed in the seminal vesicles and bulbo-urethral glands, with spermatozoa arising from the testes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0360">Smooth muscle fibres within the prostate, which are under sympathetic control, play a role in controlling urine flow through the bulbar urethra, and also contract at orgasm to move seminal fluid through ejaculatory ducts into the bulbar urethra (emission). Contraction of the bulbocavernosus muscle (via a spinal muscle reflex) then ejaculates the semen out of the urethra.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0050">The penis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0365">Blood flow into the corpus cavernosum of the penis is controlled by sympathetic nerves from the thoracolumbar plexus, which maintain smooth muscle contraction (<ce:cross-ref id="crf10080" refid="f0015">p. 383</ce:cross-ref>). In response to afferent input from the glans penis and from higher centres, pelvic splanchnic parasympathetic nerves actively relax the cavernosal smooth muscle via neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide, acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and prostacyclin, with consequent dilatation of the lacunar space. At the same time, draining venules are compressed, trapping blood in the lacunar space with consequent elevation of pressure and erection (tumescence) of the penis.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Investigation of renal and urinary tract disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Glomerular filtration rate</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0370">The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the sum of the ultrafiltration rates from plasma into the Bowman's space in each nephron and is a measure of renal excretory function. It is proportionate to body size and the reference value is usually expressed after correction for body surface area as 120 ± 25 mL/min/1.73 m<ce:sup loc="post">2</ce:sup>. The GFR may be measured directly by injecting and measuring the clearance of compounds such as inulin or radiolabelled ethylenediamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), which are completely filtered at the glomerulus and are not secreted or reabsorbed by the renal tubules (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0335" refid="b0010">Box 15.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>). This is not performed routinely, however, and is usually reserved for special circumstances, such as the assessment of renal function in potential live kidney donors. Instead, GFR is usually assessed indirectly in clinical practice by measuring serum levels of endogenously produced compounds that are excreted by the kidney. The most widely used is serum creatinine, which is produced by muscle at a constant rate, is almost completely filtered at the glomerulus, and is not reabsorbed. Although creatinine is secreted to a small degree by the proximal tubule, this is only usually significant in terms of GFR estimation in severe renal impairment, where it accounts for a larger proportion of the creatinine excreted. Accordingly, provided muscle mass remains constant, changes in serum creatinine concentrations closely reflect changes in GFR. The relationship between serum creatinine and GFR is not linear, however, and a modest elevation in serum creatinine above the normal range may therefore reflect a substantial decline in GFR (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0355" refid="f0030">Fig. 15.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>). For this reason, several methods have been developed to estimate GFR from serum creatinine measurements (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0360" refid="b0010">Box 15.1</ce:cross-ref>) but the most widely used is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Routine reporting by laboratories of estimated GFR (eGFR) has increased recognition of moderate kidney damage and encouraged early deployment of protective therapies; however, some limitations remain (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0365" refid="b0015">Boxes 15.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0375" refid="b0020">15.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/>). In particular, the MDRD formula is based on the serum creatinine value and so is heavily influenced by muscle mass; eGFR may therefore be misleading in individuals whose muscle bulk is outside the normal range for their sex and age. Measurement of other endogenous metabolites, such as cystatin C, may provide a more accurate estimate of GFR in this setting; this test, however, is not yet widely available in routine clinical practice.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0495">Direct measurement of creatinine clearance by collecting a 24-hour urine sample and relating serum creatinine levels to urinary creatinine excretion (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0405" refid="b0010">Box 15.1</ce:cross-ref>) is now less commonly performed due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate 24-hour urine collections.

White cell casts are strongly suggestive of pyelonephritis. Microscopy may also detect the presence of bacteria in those with urinary infection and crystals in patients with renal stone disease.

The fractional excretion of these ions can be calculated by the general formula: 100 × (urine concentration of analyte × serum creatinine) / (serum concentration of analyte × urinary creatinine). Calculation of fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) can help in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) to differentiate volume depletion, when the tubules are avidly conserving sodium (FENa typically &#x003C; 1.0%), from acute tubular necrosis, when the tubules are damaged and are less able to conserve sodium (FENa typically &#x003E; 1.0%).

Ultrasound can also be used to provide images of the prostate gland and bladder, and to estimate the completeness of emptying in patients with suspected bladder outflow obstruction. In addition, it can reveal other abdominal, pelvic and retroperitoneal pathology. Ultrasonography may show increased signal in the renal cortex with loss of distinction between cortex and medulla, which is characteristic of CKD. Doppler imaging can be used to study blood flow in extrarenal and larger intrarenal vessels, and to assess the resistivity index (peak systolic velocity − end-diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity in the intrarenal arteries), which may be elevated (&#x003E; 0.7) in various diseases, including acute tubular necrosis and rejection of a renal transplant.

CTU has largely replaced the previous gold-standard investigation of intravenous urography (IVU) for investigation of the upper urinary tract, having the advantage of providing complete staging information and details of surrounding organs. Contrast enhancement is particularly useful for characterising mass lesions within the kidney and differentiating benign from malignant lesions (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0425" refid="f0180">Fig. 15.32A</ce:cross-ref>, p. 435). CT without contrast gives clear definition of retroperitoneal anatomy regardless of obesity and is superior to ultrasound in this respect. Non-contrast CT of kidneys, ureters and bladder (CTKUB) is the method of choice for demonstrating stones within the kidney or ureter (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0430" refid="f0165">Fig. 15.29</ce:cross-ref>, p. 432). For investigation of patients with renal trauma, a triple-phase CT scan with a delayed phase, to assess the integrity of the collecting system, is performed. Drawbacks of contrast-enhanced CT scans include the fact that relatively large doses of contrast medium are required, which can cause renal dysfunction, and that the radiation dose is significant (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0435" refid="b0030">Box 15.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0030"/>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0145"><ce:section-title id="st0140">Magnetic resonance imaging</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0660">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers excellent resolution and gives good distinction between different tissue types (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0440" refid="f0095">Fig. 15.15</ce:cross-ref>, p. 406).

When GFR is low, urine volumes may still be normal if tubular reabsorption is also reduced; hence urine volume alone is a poor indicator of the severity of kidney disease. Oliguria and anuria may be caused by a reduction in urine production, as in pre-renal AKI, when GFR is reduced and tubular homeostatic mechanisms increase reabsorption to conserve salt and water. A high solute load or associated tubular dysfunction may, however, produce normal or high urine volumes in such cases until the pre-renal insult becomes severe and GFR is markedly reduced, such as occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis with marked glycosuria. Urine volumes are variable in AKI due to intrinsic renal disease, but a rapid decline in urine volume may be observed. Anuria should prompt a differential including complete urinary obstruction, severe vascular compromise or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0470" refid="b0040">Box 15.6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0805">Obstruction of the renal tract can produce oliguria and anuria, but to do so, obstruction must be complete and occur distal to the bladder neck, be bilateral, or be unilateral on the side of a single functioning kidney. Unilateral ureteric obstruction may not lead to any noticeable reduction in urine output. The presence of pain that is exacerbated by a fluid load suggests an acute obstruction of the renal tract, and its characteristics may be of value in reaching a diagnosis. Obstruction at the bladder neck is associated with lower midline abdominal discomfort, whereas ureteric obstruction typically presents as loin pain radiating to the groin and at the level of the renal pelvis may present as flank pain. Chronic obstruction rarely produces pain but may give rise to a dull ache. Urethral strictures should be considered as a possible cause, especially in patients with a history of instrumentation of the renal tract.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0810">The presence of bladder enlargement in a middle-aged or elderly man suggests benign or malignant enlargement of the prostate gland as a potential cause of oliguria or anuria (pp. 437 and 438).

Partial obstruction can be associated with a normal or even high urine volume due to chronic tubular injury, which causes loss of tubular concentrating ability.

It is important to stress that the histological appearance rarely confirms a specific renal disease but rather suggests a limited range of diagnoses, which may be confirmed by further investigation. Conversely, some diseases, such as lupus, are associated with more than one histological pattern of injury. The most common histological subtypes may be categorised according to their typical clinical presentation, as discussed below.

The presentation is with nephrotic syndrome, which typically is severe; it remits with high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (1 mg/kg prednisolone for 6 weeks), though the response to therapy is often less satisfactory in older patients. Some patients who respond incompletely (glucocorticoid-resistant) or relapse frequently need maintenance glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid dependence), cytotoxic therapy or other agents. Glucocorticoid resistance in children warrants a biopsy to exclude an alternative diagnosis, but if minimal change is confirmed, a genetic cause should be considered (p. 403). Minimal change disease typically does not progress to CKD but can present with problems related to the nephrotic syndrome (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0670" refid="b0070">Box 15.11</ce:cross-ref>) and complications of treatment.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0340"><ce:section-title id="st0330">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1350">Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0675" refid="f0080">Fig. 15.12B</ce:cross-ref>) can occur in all age groups but is particularly common in people of West African descent, who, compared with other ethnicities, have a much higher carriage rate of an apolipoprotein L1 (<ce:italic>APOL1</ce:italic>) gene variant that is associated with increased risk of FSGS. Histological analysis shows sclerosis initially limited to segments of the glomeruli, which may also show positive staining for deposits of C3 and IgM on immunofluorescence. Since FSGS is a focal process, abnormal glomeruli may not be seen on renal biopsy if only a few are sampled, leading to an initial diagnosis of minimal change nephropathy. In most cases the underlying cause is unknown (primary FSGS) and these patients typically present with abrupt onset of severe nephrotic syndrome. Primary FSGS may respond to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (0.5–2.0 mg/kg/day) but the response is rarely as rapid or complete as for minimal change disease. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, have also been used but their efficacy is uncertain. Progression to CKD is common in patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids and the disease frequently recurs after renal transplantation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1355">FSGS may also be secondary to other diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) renal disease (particularly in African Americans), morbid obesity or chronic hypertension.

Patients with secondary FSGS typically present with more modest proteinuria than those with primary disease and rarely exhibit full-blown nephrotic syndrome.

Haematuria is the earliest sign and non-visible haematuria is almost universal, while hypertension is also very common. These are often detected during routine screening: for example, at occupational medical examinations. Proteinuria can also occur but is usually a later feature. In many cases, there is slowly progressive loss of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A particular hallmark of IgA nephropathy in young adults is the occurrence of acute self-limiting exacerbations, often with visible haematuria, in association with minor respiratory infections. This may be so acute as to resemble acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis, with fluid retention, hypertension and oliguria with dark or red urine. Characteristically, the latency from clinical infection to nephritis is short: a few days or less. Asymptomatic presentations dominate in older adults, with non-visible haematuria, hypertension and reduction in GFR. Occasionally, IgA nephropathy progresses rapidly in association with crescent formation on biopsy. Management is largely directed towards the control of blood pressure, with renin–angiotensin system inhibitors preferable in those with proteinuria.

Significant reduction of renal blood flow occurs when there is more than 70% narrowing of the artery, and this is commonly associated with distal, post-stenotic dilatation. Atherosclerotic lesions are typically ostial and are associated with more widespread atherosclerosis within the aorta and other vessels, particularly the iliac vessels. There is often concurrent small-vessel disease in affected kidneys, due to subclinical atheroemboli. As the stenosis becomes more severe, global renal ischaemia leads to shrinkage of the affected kidney and may cause renal failure if bilateral, or if unilateral in the presence of a single kidney (ischaemic nephropathy).</ce:para><ce:para id="p1910">In younger patients, fibromuscular dysplasia is a more likely cause of renal artery stenosis.

Conversely, at least 85% of patients with renal artery stenosis will not develop progressive renal impairment, and many patients die from coronary, cerebral or other vascular disease rather than renal failure.

Acute pulmonary oedema is particularly characteristic of bilateral renovascular disease.

The risks of angioplasty and stenting include renal artery occlusion, renal infarction and atheroemboli (p. 409) from manipulations in a severely diseased aorta. Small-vessel disease distal to the stenosis may preclude substantial functional recovery.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0580"><ce:section-title id="st0560">Acute renal infarction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2000">This is an uncommon condition that occurs as the result of sudden occlusion of the renal arteries. The presentation is typically with loin pain of acute onset, usually in association with non-visible haematuria, but pain may be absent in some cases. Severe hypertension is common but not universal. Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP are commonly raised. The condition may be caused by thrombosis of a renal artery or by thromboemboli from a distant source, when occlusion may occur in branch arteries distal to the main renal artery. This can cause multiple infarcts within the renal parenchyma of both kidneys, which may be visualised by CT scanning. If occlusion of the main renal arteries is bilateral or if there is occlusion in a single functioning kidney, the presentation is with AKI and the patient is typically anuric. Patients with bilateral occlusion usually have evidence of widespread vascular disease and may show evidence of aortic occlusion, with absent femoral pulses and reduced lower limb perfusion. Management is largely supportive, and includes anticoagulation if a source of thromboembolism is identified. It is sometimes possible to perform stenting of an acutely blocked main renal artery to try to restore renal blood flow; in most cases, however, presentation is too late to salvage renal function.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0585"><ce:section-title id="st0565">Diseases of small intrarenal vessels</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0590"><ce:section-title id="st0570">Thrombotic microangiopathies</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2005">A number of conditions are associated with acute damage and occlusion of small blood vessels (arterioles and capillaries) in the kidney (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0805" refid="b0120">Box 15.23</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0120"/>) and other organs. A common feature of these syndromes is microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA), in which haemolysis and red cell fragmentation arise as consequences of damage incurred to red blood cells during passage through the abnormal vessels. The red blood cell fragments (schistocytes) may be observed on blood films, together with laboratory features of intravascular haemolysis (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0520" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#s0825">p. 947</ce:intra-ref>), including an elevated unconjugated bilirubin level, raised serum LDH concentration and decreased circulating levels of haptoglobin.

The <ce:italic>E. coli</ce:italic> O157:H7 serotype is the best known but other serotypes that produce verotoxins may also be responsible. Although these bacteria live as commensals in the gut of cattle and other livestock, they can cause haemorrhagic diarrhoea in humans when the infection is contracted from contaminated food products, water or other infected individuals. In a proportion of cases, verotoxin produced by the organisms enters the circulation and binds to specific glycolipid receptors that are expressed on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells. Most cases are sporadic but large outbreaks related to poor sanitation may occur. In developed countries, Shiga-like toxin-associated HUS is now the most common cause of AKI in children.

In addition, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in CKD. Accordingly, ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs should be prescribed to all patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients with CKD and proteinuria, irrespective of whether or not hypertension is present.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2520">While ACE inhibitors and ARBs are excellent drugs for patients with diabetes or CKD and proteinuria, they need to be prescribed with care in certain circumstances. Initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be accompanied by an immediate reduction in GFR; patients should therefore have their renal function checked within 7–10 days of initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Treatment can be continued so long as the reduction in GFR is not greater than 25% and is not progressive. Angiotensin II is critical for autoregulation of GFR in the context of low renal perfusion (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0990" refid="f0025">Fig. 15.1D</ce:cross-ref>, p. 385), and so ACE inhibitors or ARBs may exacerbate pre-renal failure (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0995" refid="f0115">Fig. 15.19</ce:cross-ref>). Patients on ACE inhibitors/ARBs should therefore be warned to stop taking the medication if they become unwell, such as with fever, vomiting or diarrhoea, restarting once they are better. This also applies to other common medications used in patients with CKD, such as diuretics, metformin and NSAIDs, and this advice may be reinforced by providing written information such as ‘sick-day rule’ cards (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1000" refid="b0165">Box 15.31</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0165"/>).

In patients with serum potassium &#x003E; 6.0 mmol/L, the dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be reduced or discontinued entirely, but only after all other measures to reduce potassium have been considered (see below).

Calcium resonium is not recommended other than as a very short-term measure, as it can be associated with bowel necrosis; however, newer agents, such as zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer, appear promising for chronic use. Other measures that may help regulate potassium include diuretic therapy and control of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate (see below). Consideration should be given to stopping or reducing drugs that elevate potassium, such as potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors/ARBs; however, this has to be balanced against the potential benefit that such drugs may have on retarding progression of renal and cardiovascular disease, and hence withdrawal should be reserved for when other measures have failed.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2610">The inability of the failing kidney to excrete sodium and water loads commonly leads to their accumulation, which may manifest as oedema and may drive hypertension.

The sequence of events that leads to renal bone disease is complex, but two primary factors are impaired excretion of phosphate and failure of the renal tubular cells to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. A rise in serum phosphate levels promotes production of the hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) from osteocytes (<ce:intra-ref id="ii9015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#f0030">Fig. 24.3</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0740" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#s0045">p. 986</ce:intra-ref>) and stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) release and hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. The FGF23 and PTH promote tubular phosphate excretion, thereby partly compensating for the reduced glomerular filtration of phosphate. The reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels impair intestinal absorption of calcium. In addition, raised levels of serum phosphate complex with calcium in the extracellular space, leading to calcium phosphate deposition. Both the reduced absorption and increased deposition of calcium cause hypocalcaemia, which also stimulates PTH production by the parathyroid glands. Hence in many patients with CKD, compensatory responses initially maintain phosphate and calcium levels at the upper and lower ends of their respective normal ranges, at the expense of an elevated PTH level (secondary hyperparathyroidism). This is associated with a gradual transfer of calcium and phosphate from the bone to other tissues, leading to bone resorption (osteitis fibrosa cystica), and in severe cases this may result in bony pain and increased risk of fractures. Conversely there is increased deposition of calcium phosphate in many tissues, most notably blood vessels and heart valves, which may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD (p. 420). In some cases, tertiary hyperparathyroidism supervenes, due to autonomous production of PTH by the enlarged parathyroid glands; this presents with hypercalcaemia. Additional problems in bone metabolism include low bone turnover (adynamic bone disease) in patients who have been over-treated with vitamin D metabolites, osteomalacia with over-treatment of hyperphosphataemia (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0750" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#p2730">p. 369</ce:intra-ref>), and osteoporosis in patients with poor nutritional intake.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2630">The key focus in the management of renal bone disease should be directed towards the two main driving factors, hyperphosphataemia and inadequate activation of vitamin D. Hyperphosphataemia should be treated by dietary restriction of foods with high phosphate content (milk, cheese, eggs and protein-rich foods) and by the use of phosphate-binding drugs. Various drugs are available, including calcium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide, lanthanum carbonate and polymer-based phosphate binders such as sevelamer. The aim is to maintain serum phosphate values at or below 1.5 mmol/L (4.6 mg/dL) if possible, but many of these drugs are difficult to take and adherence can be a problem. Active vitamin D metabolites (either 1-α-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) should be administered in patients who are hypocalcaemic or have serum PTH levels more than twice the upper limit of normal. The dose should be adjusted to try to reduce PTH levels to between 2 and 4 times the upper limit of normal to limit hyperparathyroidism while avoiding over-suppression of bone turnover and adynamic bone disease, but care must be exercised in order to avoid hypercalcaemia. In patients with persistent hypercalcaemia (tertiary hyperparathyroidism), parathyroidectomy may be required. If parathyroidectomy is unsuccessful or not possible, calcimimetic agents, such as cinacalcet, may be used. These bind to the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid glands and reduce PTH secretion.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0840"><ce:section-title id="st0795">Anaemia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2635">Anaemia is common in patients with CKD and contributes to many of the non-specific symptoms, including fatigue and shortness of breath.

Iron deficiency is common in patients with CKD, and even more prevalent in those on haemodialysis as a result of haemolysis in the dialysis circuit. Hence many patients require iron supplements, which may be given intravenously for those with iron intolerance or in situations where adherence may be difficult. Once iron deficiency and other causes of anaemia have been excluded or corrected, recombinant human erythropoietin is very effective in correcting the anaemia of CKD and improving symptoms. Erythropoietin treatment does not influence mortality, however, and correcting haemoglobin to normal levels may carry some extra risk, including hypertension and thrombosis. The target haemoglobin is usually between 100 and 120 g/L. Erythropoietin is less effective in the presence of iron deficiency, active inflammation or malignancy, in particular myeloma.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0845"><ce:section-title id="st0800">Treatment of risk factors for cardiovascular disease</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2670">The risk of cardiovascular disease is substantially increased in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m<ce:sup loc="post">2</ce:sup> and in those with proteinuria, the combination of reduced eGFR and proteinuria being particularly unfavourable. Patients with CKD have a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes; however, additional mechanisms of cardiovascular disease may also be implicated. Left ventricular hypertrophy is commonly found in patients with CKD, secondary to hypertension or anaemia. Calcification of the media of blood vessels, heart valves, myocardium and the conduction system of the heart is also common and may be due, in part, to the high serum phosphate levels. Reflecting this fact, serum FGF23 levels, which increase in response to serum phosphate, are an independent predictor of mortality in CKD. Both left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac calcification may increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, which is a much more common mode of death in patients with CKD than in the general population, particularly in those with more advanced disease and those on dialysis.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2675">To reduce vascular risk, patients with CKD should be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, and weight loss and smoking cessation where appropriate.

The first is to decide whether RRT is an appropriate choice or whether conservative treatment might be preferable (p. 421). This is especially relevant in patients with significant comorbidity. For those who decide to go ahead with RRT, there are further choices between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1025" refid="b0180">Box 15.34</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0180"/>), between hospital and home treatment, and on referral for renal transplantation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2695">Since there is no evidence that early initiation of RRT improves outcome, the overall aim is to commence RRT when symptoms of CKD begin to impact on quality of life but before serious complications have occurred.

Depression is common in patients who are on or approaching RRT, and support from the renal multidisciplinary team should be provided both for them and for their relatives, to explain and help them adapt to the changes to lifestyle that may be necessary once RRT starts; this may help to reduce their anxieties about these changes.

Since the advent of long-term RRT in the 1960s, the numbers of patients with ESRD who are kept alive by dialysis and transplantation have increased considerably. By the end of 2014, almost 59 000 patients were on RRT in the UK, with a median age of 65 years. After a long period of expansion, the number of patients on dialysis in the UK and USA has begun to stabilise; however, the total number of patients on RRT continues to expand, due to an increasing proportion (53%) of patients with a functional transplant. The remaining patients were on haemodialysis (41%) and peritoneal dialysis (6%).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2710">There are variations in the numbers of patients receiving RRT in different countries because of differences in the incidence of predisposing disease, as well as differences in medical practice. For example, the incidence rate for RRT in the USA was about three times higher than in the UK (363 versus 115 patients per million population), and the prevalence rate was more than twice as high (2034 versus 913 per million population). Diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of ESRD in many countries, accounting for 26% of all ESRD in the UK and almost 50% in the USA. The large increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in developing countries is resulting in a predictable rise in cases of ESRD, which is challenging already stretched health-care resources.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2715">Survival on dialysis is strongly influenced by age and presence of complications such as diabetes (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1040" refid="f0150">Fig. 15.26</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0150"/>). For this reason, conservative care rather than RRT may be a more appropriate option for older patients or those with extensive comorbidities Although many young patients without extrarenal disease lead normal and active lives on RRT, those aged 30–34 have a mortality rate 25 times higher than that of age-matched controls.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2720">The aim of RRT is to replace the excretory functions of the kidney and to maintain normal electrolyte concentrations and fluid balance. Various options are available, including haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration, peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation, and each of these is discussed in more detail below. Indications for starting RRT in both AKI and CKD may be found in <ce:cross-ref id="crf1045" refid="b0140">Box 15.35</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0140"/>.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0860"><ce:section-title id="st0815">Conservative treatment</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2725">In older patients with multiple comorbidities, conservative treatment of stage 5 CKD, aimed at limiting the adverse symptoms of ESRD without commencing RRT, is increasingly viewed as a positive choice (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1050" refid="b0185">Box 15.36</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0185"/>). Current evidence suggests that survival of these patients without dialysis can be similar or only slightly shorter than that of patients who undergo RRT, but they avoid the hospitalisation and interventions associated with dialysis. Patients are offered full medical, psychological and social support to optimise and sustain their existing renal function and to treat complications, such as anaemia, for as long as possible, with appropriate palliative care in the terminal phase of their disease. Many of these patients enjoy a good quality of life for several years. When quality of life on dialysis is poor, it is appropriate to consider discontinuing it, following discussion with the patient and family, and to offer palliative care.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0865"><ce:section-title id="st0820">Haemodialysis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2770">Haemodialysis is the most common form of RRT in ESRD and is also used in AKI. Haemodialysis involves gaining access to the circulation, either through a central venous catheter or an arteriovenous fistula or graft. The patient's blood is pumped through a haemodialyser, which allows bidirectional diffusion of solutes between blood and the dialysate across a semipermeable membrane down a concentration gradient (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1055" refid="f0145">Fig. 15.25A</ce:cross-ref>). The composition of the dialysate can be varied to achieve the desired gradient, and fluid can be removed by applying negative pressure to the dialysate side.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0870"><ce:section-title id="st0825">Haemodialysis in AKI</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2775">Haemodialysis offers the best rate of small solute clearance in AKI, compared with other techniques such as haemofiltration, but should be started gradually because of the risk of delirium and convulsions due to cerebral oedema (dialysis disequilibrium). Typically, 1–2 hours of dialysis is prescribed initially but, subsequently, patients with AKI who are haemodynamically stable can be treated by 4–5 hours of haemodialysis on alternate days, or 2–3 hours every day. During dialysis, it is standard practice to anticoagulate patients with heparin but the dose may be reduced if there is a bleeding risk. Epoprostenol can be used as an alternative but carries a risk of hypotension. In patients undergoing short treatments and in those with abnormal clotting, it may be possible to avoid anticoagulation altogether. In AKI, dialysis is performed through a large-bore, dual-lumen catheter inserted into the femoral or internal jugular vein (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1060" refid="f0155">Fig. 15.27A</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0155"/>). Subclavian lines are avoided where possible, largely due to bleeding risk. Also, thromboses or stenoses here will compromise the ability to form a functioning fistula in the arm if the patient fails to recover renal function and needs chronic dialysis.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0875"><ce:section-title id="st0830">Haemodialysis in CKD</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2780">In CKD, vascular access for haemodialysis is gained by formation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), usually in the forearm, up to a year before dialysis is contemplated (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1065" refid="f0155">Fig. 15.27B</ce:cross-ref>). After 4–6 weeks, increased pressure transmitted from the artery to the vein leading from the fistula causes distension and thickening of the vessel wall (arterialisation). Large-bore needles can then be inserted into the vein to provide access for each haemodialysis treatment.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2785">Preservation of arm veins is thus very important in patients with progressive renal disease who may require haemodialysis in the future. If creation of an AVF is not possible, synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts may be fashioned between an artery and a vein, or central venous catheters may be used for short-term access (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1070" refid="f0155">Fig. 15.27C</ce:cross-ref>). These are tunnelled under the skin to reduce infection risk. All patients must be screened in advance for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, and vaccinated against hepatitis B if they are not immune.

Large volumes of water are filtered from blood across a porous semipermeable membrane under a pressure gradient. Solutes are removed via ‘solvent drag’. Replacement fluid of a suitable electrolyte composition is added to the blood after it exits the haemofilter. If removal of fluid is required, then less fluid is added back than is removed (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1090" refid="f0145">Fig. 15.25B</ce:cross-ref>). Haemofiltration may be either intermittent or continuous, and typically 1–2 L of filtrate is replaced per hour (equivalent to a GFR of 15–30 mL/min/1.73 m<ce:sup loc="post">2</ce:sup>); higher rates of filtration may be of benefit in patients with sepsis and multi-organ failure. In continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration (CAVH), the extracorporeal blood circuit is driven by the arteriovenous pressure difference, but poor filtration rates and clotting of the filter are common and this treatment has fallen out of favour. Continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) is pump-driven, providing a reliable extracorporeal circulation.

It requires the insertion of a permanent Silastic catheter into the peritoneal cavity (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1100" refid="f0145">Fig. 15.25C</ce:cross-ref>). Two types are in common use. In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), about 2 L of sterile, isotonic dialysis fluid are introduced and left in place for approximately 4–6 hours. Metabolic waste products diffuse from peritoneal capillaries into the dialysis fluid down a concentration gradient. The fluid is then drained and fresh dialysis fluid introduced, in a continuous four-times-daily cycle. The inflow fluid is rendered hyperosmolar by the addition of glucose or glucose polymer; this results in net removal of fluid from the patient during each cycle, due to diffusion of water from the blood through the peritoneal membrane down an osmotic gradient (ultrafiltration). The patient is mobile and able to undertake normal daily activities. Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is similar to CAPD but uses a mechanical device to perform the fluid exchanges during the night, leaving the patient free, or with only a single exchange to perform, during the day.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2855">CAPD is particularly useful in children, as a first treatment in adults with residual renal function, and as a treatment for elderly patients with cardiovascular instability.

Compatibility of ABO blood group between donor and recipient is usually required and the degree of matching for major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, particularly human leucocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), influences the incidence of rejection. Immediately prior to transplantation, cross-matching should be performed for anti-HLA antibodies (traditionally mixing of recipient serum with donor lymphocytes) (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0765" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00004-4#s0735">p. 88</ce:intra-ref>). Positive tests predict early rejection and worse graft survival. Although some ABO- and HLA-incompatible transplants are now possible, this involves appropriate preparation with pre-transplant plasma exchange and/or immunosuppression, so that recipient antibodies to the donor's tissue are reduced to acceptably low levels. This option is generally only available for living donor transplants because of the preparation required.

A common regimen is triple therapy with prednisolone; ciclosporin or tacrolimus; and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Sirolimus is an alternative that can be introduced later but is generally not used initially due to impaired wound healing. Antibodies to deplete or modulate specific lymphocyte populations are increasingly used for induction and for treatment of glucocorticoid-resistant acute rejection. Basiliximab, an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist, is frequently used at induction to lower rates of rejection. Acute cellular rejection is usually treated, in the first instance, by short courses of high-dose glucocorticoids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone on three consecutive days. Anti-lymphocyte preparations (e.g. anti-thymocyte globulin, ATG) are used for glucocorticoid-resistant rejection.

In an otherwise healthy woman with a single lower urinary tract infection, urine culture prior to treatment is not mandatory. Investigation is necessary, however, in patients with recurrent infection or after failure of initial treatment, during pregnancy, or in patients susceptible to serious infection, such as the immunocompromised, those with diabetes or an indwelling catheter, and older people (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1180" refid="b0235">Box 15.46</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0235"/>). The diagnosis can be made from the combination of typical clinical features and abnormalities on urinalysis. Most urinary pathogens can reduce nitrate to nitrite, and neutrophils and nitrites can usually be detected in symptomatic infections by urine dipstick tests for leucocyte esterase and nitrite, respectively. The absence of both nitrites and leucocyte esterase in the urine makes UTI unlikely. Interpretation of bacterial counts in the urine, and of what is a ‘significant’ culture result, is based on probabilities. Urine taken by suprapubic aspiration should be sterile, so the presence of any organisms is significant. If the patient has symptoms and there are neutrophils in the urine, a small number of organisms is significant.

Some patients present suddenly with acute urinary retention, when they are unable to micturate and develop a painful, distended bladder.

The first-line treatments are α<ce:inf loc="post">1A</ce:inf>-adrenoceptor blockers such as tamsulosin, which reduce the tone of smooth muscle cells in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby reducing the obstruction.

Patients who fail to respond to a single drug may be treated with a combination of α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, since this is more efficacious than either agent alone. Symptoms that are resistant to medical therapy require surgical treatment to remove some of the prostate tissue that is causing urethral obstruction. This is usually achieved by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) but enucleation of the prostate by holmium laser or vaporisation by potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser (Greenlight laser) is equally effective and has potentially fewer complications. Open surgery is rarely needed, unless the gland is very large.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1355"><ce:section-title id="st1275">Prostate cancer</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3905">Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the UK, with a prevalence of 105 per 100 000 population. It is also common in northern Europe and the USA (particularly in the African American population) but is rare in China and Japan. It is uncommon in India but the incidence is increasing. Prostate cancer rarely occurs before the age of 50 and has a mean age at presentation of 70 years.</ce:para><ce:section id="s1360"><ce:section-title id="st1280">Pathophysiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3910">Prostate cancers tend to arise within the peripheral zone of the prostate and almost all are adenocarcinomas. Metastatic spread to pelvic lymph nodes occurs early and metastases to bone, mainly the lumbar spine and pelvis, are common. Genetic factors are known to play an important role in pathogenesis, and multiple genetic loci have been found to predispose to the disease in genome-wide association studies. A family history of prostate cancer greatly increases a man's chances of developing the disease.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1365"><ce:section-title id="st1285">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3915">Most patients either are asymptomatic or present with lower urinary tract symptoms indistinguishable from BPE. On DRE the prostate may feel nodular and stony-hard, and the median sulcus may be lost, but up to 45% of tumours are impalpable. Symptoms and signs due to metastases are much less common at the initial presentation but may include back pain, weight loss, anaemia and obstruction of the ureters.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1370"><ce:section-title id="st1290">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3920">Measurement of PSA levels in a peripheral blood sample, together with DRE, is the cornerstone of diagnosis. Prior to a PSA test, men should be given careful counselling about the limitations of the test: namely, a normal level does not exclude prostate cancer, while a high value does not confirm the diagnosis but will open a discussion about biopsy and possible future treatments with potential side-effects (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1365" refid="b0290">Box 15.57</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0290"/>). The need for radical treatment of localised prostate cancer is still not established; radical treatments have significant potential morbidity and mortality, yet early identification and treatment of prostate cancer may save lives. Current evidence suggests that population-based screening for prostate cancer with PSA is of limited value, due in part to the fact that over 700 patients would need to be screened to cure 1 man of prostate cancer. Individuals suspected of having prostate cancer, based on an elevated PSA and/or abnormal DRE, should undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. About 40% of patients with a serum PSA of 4.0–10 ng/mL or more will have prostate cancer on biopsy, although 25% of patients with a PSA of less than 4 ng/mL may also have prostate cancer. Occasionally, a small focus of tumour is found incidentally in patients undergoing TURP for benign hyperplasia. If the diagnosis of prostate cancer is confirmed, staging should be performed by pelvic MRI to assess the presence and extent of local involvement. An isotope bone scan should be carried out if distant metastases are suspected (rare if the PSA is below 20 ng/mL); very high levels of serum PSA (&#x003E; 100 ng/mL) almost always indicate distant bone metastases. Following diagnosis, serial assessment of PSA levels is useful for monitoring response to treatment and disease progression.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1385"><ce:section-title id="st1305">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3965">Tumour confined to the prostate is potentially curable by radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy or brachytherapy (implantation of small radioactive particles into the prostate). These options should be considered only in patients with more than 10 years' life expectancy. Patients who are found to have small-volume, low-grade disease do not appear to require specific treatment but should be followed up periodically with PSA testing, DRE and a schedule of biopsies; this is known as active surveillance. Prostatic cancer, like breast cancer, is sensitive to steroid hormones; metastatic prostate cancer is treated by androgen depletion, involving either surgery (orchidectomy) or, more commonly, androgen-suppressing drugs. Androgen receptor blockers, such as bicalutamide or cyproterone acetate, may also prevent tumour cell growth. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, such as goserelin, continuously occupy pituitary receptors, preventing them from responding to the GnRH pulses that normally stimulate luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release. This initially causes an increase in testosterone before producing a prolonged reduction, and for this reason the initial dose must be covered with an androgen receptor blocker to prevent a tumour flare.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3970">A small proportion of patients fail to respond to endocrine treatment. A larger number respond for a year or two but then the disease progresses. Chemotherapy with docetaxel can then be effective and provide a modest (around 3 months) survival advantage. Radiotherapy is useful for localised bone pain but the basis of treatment remains pain control by analgesia (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0970" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00033-0#s0400">p. 1331</ce:intra-ref>). Provided that patients do not die of another cause, the 10-year survival rate of patients with tumours localised to the prostate is 95%, but if metastases are present, this falls to 10%.

They occur mainly in young men aged between 20 and 40 years. They often secrete α-fetoprotein (AFP) and β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG), which are useful biochemical markers for both diagnosis and prognosis. Seminoma and teratoma account for 85% of all tumours of the testis.

They may contain cartilage, bone, muscle, fat and a variety of other tissues, and are classified according to the degree of differentiation.

Vascular, neuropathic and psychological causes are most common. Exclusion of previously unrecognised cardiovascular disease is important in men presenting with erectile dysfunction. With the exception of diabetes mellitus, endocrine causes are relatively uncommon and are characterised by loss of libido, as well as erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction and reduced libido occur in over 50% of men with advanced CKD or those on dialysis, and is a markedly under-diagnosed problem. It is important to discuss matters frankly with the patient, and to establish whether there are associated features of hypogonadism (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0980" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#p2280">p. 655</ce:intra-ref>) and if erections occur at any other time.

Co-administration of these drugs with nitric oxide donors, such as glycerol trinitrate, is contraindicated because of the risk of severe hypotension. Other treatments for impotence include self-administered intracavernosal injection or urethral administration of prostaglandin E1; vacuum devices that achieve an erection maintained by a tourniquet around the base of the penis; and prosthetic implants, either of a fixed rod or an inflatable reservoir. Psychotherapy involving the patient and sexual partner may be helpful for psychological problems. Erectile dysfunction associated with peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease is difficult to treat.
