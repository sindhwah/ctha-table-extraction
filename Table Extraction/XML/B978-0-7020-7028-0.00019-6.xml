BMR declines from middle age and is lower in women, even after adjustment for body size because of differences in fat-free mass. <ce:bold>C</ce:bold> Energy is required for movement and activity. Physical activity level (PAL) is the multiple of BMR by which total energy expenditure is increased by activity. <ce:bold>D</ce:bold> Energy is consumed in order to digest food. *Leisure or sport activity increases PAL by ~0.3 for each 30–60 minutes of moderate exercise performed 4–5 times per week.

It is vital to be aware of under-nutrition as a potential reason for any acute medical presentation or as a modifier of it. Early nutritional assessment is crucial and a dietary history provides useful information (especially when taken by a dietitian). Points to note include past medical and surgical history (e.g. abdominal or intestinal surgery), a drug history and a specific diet history. Evidence of recent weight loss and muscle wasting should be sought. Simple, validated tools are available to screen patients for nutritional problems. Body composition reflects energy balance and is assessed by clinical anthropomorphic measurements. More sophisticated techniques may be used to assess body composition or functional capacity if required.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0070"><ce:display><ce:textbox id="b0010" role="alt1"><ce:alt-text

id="p0275">Obtaining adequate nutrition is a fundamental requirement for the survival of every individual and species. The politics of food provision for humans are complex and constitute a prominent factor in wars, natural disasters and the global economy. In recent decades, economic success has been rewarded by plentiful nutrition unknown to previous generations, which has led to a pandemic of obesity and its consequences for health, yet in many parts of the world, famine and under-nutrition still represent a huge burden. Quality, as well as quantity, of food influences health, with governmental advice on healthy diets maximising fruit and vegetable intakes (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0060" refid="f0030">Fig. 19.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>). Inappropriate diets have been linked to diseases such as coronary heart disease and cancer. Deficiencies of vitamins or minerals lead to avoidable conditions, such as anaemia due to iron deficiency or blindness due to severe vitamin A deficiency. A proper understanding of nutrition is therefore essential in dealing with the needs of individual patients and in informing the planning of public policy.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section-title id="st0065">Physiology of nutrition</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0280">Nutrients in the diet can be classified into ‘macronutrients’, which are eaten in relatively large amounts to provide fuel for energy, and ‘micronutrients’ (e.g. vitamins and minerals), which do not contribute to energy balance but are required in small amounts because they are not synthesised in the body.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0070"><ce:section-title id="st0070">Energy balance</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0285">The laws of thermodynamics dictate that energy balance is achieved when energy intake = energy expenditure (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0065" refid="f0035">Fig. 19.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0035"/>). Energy expenditure has several components. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) describes the obligatory energy expenditure required to maintain metabolic functions in tissues and hence sustain life. It is most closely predicted by fat-free mass (i.e. total body mass minus fat mass), which is lower in females and older people (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0075" refid="f0035">Fig. 19.2B</ce:cross-ref>). Extra metabolic energy is consumed during growth, pregnancy and lactation, and when febrile. Metabolic energy is also required for thermal regulation, and expenditure is higher in cold or hot environments. The energy required for digestion of food (diet-induced thermogenesis; <ce:cross-ref id="crf0080" refid="f0035">Fig. 19.2D</ce:cross-ref>) accounts for approximately 10% of total energy expenditure, with protein requiring more energy than other macronutrients. Another component of energy expenditure is governed by the level of muscular activity, which can vary considerably with occupation and lifestyle (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0085" refid="f0035">Fig. 19.2C</ce:cross-ref>). Physical activity levels are usually defined as multiples of BMR.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0290">Energy intake is determined by the ‘macronutrient’ content of food. Carbohydrates, fat, protein and alcohol provide fuel for oxidation in the mitochondria to generate energy (as adenosine triphosphate (ATP); <ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00003-2#s0195">p. 49</ce:intra-ref>).

A link with reproductive function ensures that pregnancy is most likely to occur during times of nutritional plenty, when both mother and baby have a better chance of survival.

Some starches are digested promptly by salivary and then pancreatic amylase, however, producing rapid delivery of glucose to the blood. Other starches are digested more slowly, either because they are protected in the structure of the food, or because of their crystal structure, or because the molecule is unbranched (amylose).

They undergo further desaturation and elongation, to produce, for example, γ-linolenic acid (18 : 3 ω6) and arachidonic acid (20 : 4 ω6). These are precursors of prostaglandins and eicosanoids, and form part of the structure of lipid membranes in all cells. Fish oils are rich in ω3 PUFA (e.g. eicosapentaenoic (20 : 5 ω3) and docosahexaenoic (22 : 6 ω3), which promote the anti-inflammatory cascade of prostaglandin production and occur in the lipids of the human brain and retina.

It is clear, however, that the lowest mortality rates are seen in Europeans in the BMI range 18.5–24 kg/m<ce:sup loc="post">2</ce:sup> (and at lower BMI in Asians).

Increased intra-abdominal fat causes ‘central’ (‘abdominal’, ‘visceral’, ‘android’ or ‘apple-shaped’) obesity, which contrasts with subcutaneous fat accumulation causing ‘generalised’ (‘gynoid’ or ‘pear-shaped’) obesity; the former is more common in men and is more closely associated with type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0155" refid="f0050">Fig. 19.5</ce:cross-ref>). The key difference between these depots of fat may lie in their vascular anatomy, with intra-abdominal fat draining into the portal vein and thence directly to the liver. Thus many factors that are released from adipose tissue (including free fatty acids; ‘adipokines’, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin and resistin) may be at higher concentration in the liver and muscle, and hence induce insulin resistance and promote type 2 diabetes. Recent research has also highlighted the importance of fat deposition within specific organs, especially the liver, as an important determinant of metabolic risk in the obese.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0140"><ce:section-title id="st0135">Aetiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0490">Accumulation of fat results from a discrepancy between energy consumption and energy expenditure that is too large to be defended by the hypothalamic regulation of BMR.

Given the cumulative effects of subtle energy excess, body fat content shows ‘tracking’ with age, such that obese children usually become obese adults.

The estimated average global daily supply of food energy per person increased from approximately 9.8 MJ (2350 kcal) in the 1960s to approximately 11.7 MJ (2800 kcal) in the 1990s, but its delivery is unequal. For example, in India it is estimated that 5% of the population receives 40% of the available food energy, leading to obesity in the urban population in parallel with under-nutrition in some rural communities. In affluent societies, a significant proportion of this food supply is discarded. In the USA, men's average daily energy intake reportedly rose from 10.2 MJ (2450 kcal) in 1971 to 11.0 MJ (2618 kcal) in 2000. Portion sizes, particularly of energy-dense foods such as drinks with highly refined sugar content and salty snacks, have increased. However, UK data suggest that energy intakes have declined (which may in part be due to deliberate restriction or ‘dieting’), but this is apparently insufficient to compensate for the decrease in physical activity in recent years. Obesity is correlated positively with the number of hours spent watching television, and inversely with levels of physical activity (e.g. stair climbing). It is suggested that minor activities such as fidgeting, also termed non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), may contribute to energy expenditure and protect against obesity.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0145"><ce:section-title id="st0140">Susceptibility to obesity</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0555">Susceptibility to obesity and its adverse consequences undoubtedly varies between individuals.

Often weight will have oscillated between periods of successful weight loss and then regain of weight. These patients may hold misconceptions that they have an underlying disease, inaccurate perceptions of their energy intake and expenditure, and an unrealistic view of the target weight that they would regard as a ‘success’. An empathetic explanation of energy balance, which recognises that some individuals are more susceptible to obesity than others and may find it more difficult to lose body weight and sustain this loss, is important. Exclusion of underlying ‘hormone imbalance’ with simple tests is reassuring and shifts the focus on to consideration of energy balance. Appropriate goals for weight loss should be agreed, recognising that the slope of the relationship between obesity and many of its complications becomes steeper with increasing BMI, so that a given amount of weight loss achieves greater risk reduction at higher levels of BMI. A reasonable goal for most patients is to lose 5–10% of body weight.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0685">The management plan will vary according to the severity of the obesity (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0210" refid="b0055">Box 19.7</ce:cross-ref>) and the associated risk factors and complications. It will also be influenced by availability of resources; health-care providers and regulators have generally been careful not to recommend expensive interventions (especially long-term drug therapy and surgery) for everyone who is overweight. Instead, most guidelines focus resources on short-term interventions in those who have high health risks and comorbidities associated with their obesity, and who have demonstrated their capacity to alter their lifestyle to achieve weight loss (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0215" refid="f0060">Fig. 19.7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0060"/>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s0165"><ce:section-title id="st0160">Lifestyle advice</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0690">Behavioural modification to avoid some of the effects of the ‘obesogenic’ environment (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0220" refid="b0045">Box 19.5</ce:cross-ref>) is the cornerstone of long-term control of weight. Adopting regular eating patterns and maximising physical activity are advised, with reference to the modest extra activity required to increase physical activity level (PAL) ratios (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0225" refid="f0035">Fig. 19.2C</ce:cross-ref>). Where possible, this should be incorporated in the daily routine (e.g. walking rather than driving to work), as this is more likely to be sustained. Alternative exercise (e.g. swimming) may be considered if musculoskeletal complications prevent walking. Changes in eating behaviour (including food selection, portion size control, avoidance of snacking, regular meals to encourage satiety, and substitution of sugar with artificial sweeteners) should be discussed. Regular support from a dietitian or attendance at a weight loss group may be helpful.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0170"><ce:section-title id="st0165">Weight loss diets</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0695">In overweight people, adherence to the lifestyle advice given above may gradually induce weight loss. In obese patients, more active intervention is usually required to lose weight before conversion to the ‘weight maintenance’ advice given above. A significant industry has developed in marketing diets for weight loss. These vary substantially in their balance of macronutrients (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0230" refid="b0060">Box 19.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0060"/>) but there is little evidence that they vary in their medium-term (1-year) efficacy. Most involve recommending a reduction of daily total energy intake of −2.5 MJ (600 kcal) from the patient's normal consumption. Modelling data that take into account the reduced energy expenditure as weight is lost suggest that a reduction of energy intake of 100 kJ per day will lead to an eventual body weight change of about 1 kg, with half of the weight change being achieved in about 1 year and 95% of the weight change in about 3 years. Weight loss is highly variable and patient adherence is the major determinant of success. There is some evidence that weight loss diets are most effective in their early weeks and that adherence is improved by novelty of the diet; this provides some justification for switching to a different dietary regimen when weight loss slows on the first diet. Vitamin supplementation is wise in those diets in which macronutrient balance is markedly disturbed.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0705">In some patients, more rapid weight loss is required, e.g. in preparation for surgery. There is no role for starvation diets, which risk profound loss of muscle mass and the development of arrhythmias (and even sudden death) secondary to elevated free fatty acids, ketosis and deranged electrolytes. Very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs) can be considered for short-term rapid weight loss, producing losses of 1.5–2.5 kg/week, compared to 0.5 kg/week on conventional regimens, but require the supervision of an experienced physician and nutritionist. The composition of the diet should ensure a minimum of 50 g of protein each day for men and 40 g for women to minimise muscle degradation. Energy content should be a minimum of 1.65 MJ (400 kcal) for women of height &#x003C; 1.73 m, and 2.1 MJ (500 kcal) for all men and for women taller than 1.73 m.

The side-effect profile has limited the use of many agents, with notable withdrawals from clinical use of sibutramine (increased cardiovascular events) and rimonabant (psychiatric side-effects) in recent years. Orlistat has been available for many years, and four drugs or drug combinations have recently been approved in the USA and two of these in Europe. There is no role for diuretics, or for thyroxine therapy without biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism. Drug therapy should always be used as an adjunct to lifestyle advice and support, which should be continued throughout treatment.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0715">Orlistat inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipases and thereby decreases the hydrolysis of ingested triglycerides, reducing dietary fat absorption by approximately 30%. The drug is not absorbed and adverse side-effects relate to the effect of the resultant fat malabsorption on the gut: namely, loose stools, oily spotting, faecal urgency, flatus and the potential for malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Orlistat at the standard dose of 120 mg is taken with each of the three main meals of the day; a lower dose (60 mg) is available without prescription in some countries. Its efficacy is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0235" refid="f0065">Figure 19.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0065"/>; these effects may be explained because patients taking orlistat adhere better to low-fat diets in order to avoid unpleasant gastrointestinal side-effects.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0720">The combination of low-dose phentermine and topiramate extended release has been approved in the USA; this results in weight loss of approximately 6% greater than placebo and benefits lipids and glucose concentrations.

The 5-HT<ce:inf loc="post">2c</ce:inf> agonist lorcaserin is also approved in the USA; it is moderately effective and has a relatively low rate of adverse effects. The combination of the opioid antagonist naltrexone and the noradrenaline (norepinephrine)/dopamine re-uptake inhibitor bupropion is also effective. The main adverse effects are dry mouth and constipation. Finally, a higher dose of the injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide (3 mg) is also approved for use and has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes in patients with pre-diabetes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0725">Drug therapy is usually reserved for patients with high risk of complications from obesity (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0240" refid="f0060">Fig. 19.7</ce:cross-ref>), and its optimum timing and duration are controversial. There is evidence that those patients who demonstrate early weight loss (usually defined as 5% after 12 weeks on the optimum dose) achieve greater and longer-term weight loss, and this is reflected in most guidelines for the use of drugs for obesity. Treatment can be stopped in non-responders at this point and an alternative treatment considered. Although life-long therapy is advocated for many drugs that reduce risk on the basis of relatively short-term research trials (e.g. drugs for hypertension and osteoporosis), some patients who continue to take anti-obesity drugs tend to regain weight with time; this may partly reflect age-related weight gain, but significant weight gain should prompt reinforcement of lifestyle advice and, if this is unsuccessful, drug therapy should be discontinued (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0245" refid="f0065">Fig. 19.8</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0180"><ce:section-title id="st0175">Surgery</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0730">‘Bariatric’ surgery is by far the most effective long-term treatment for obesity (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0250" refid="f0065">Fig. 19.8</ce:cross-ref> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0255" refid="b0065">Box 19.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0065"/>) and is the only anti-obesity intervention that has been associated with reduced mortality.

Only experienced specialist surgeons should undertake these procedures, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team. Several approaches are used (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0265" refid="f0070">Fig. 19.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0070"/>) and all can be performed laparoscopically. The mechanism of weight loss may not simply relate to limiting the stomach or absorptive capacity, but rather in disrupting the release of ghrelin from the stomach or promoting the release of other peptides from the small bowel, thereby enhancing satiety signalling in the hypothalamus. Diabetes may improve rapidly after surgery, particularly after gastric bypass, and although this may be attributed to severe energy restriction in the perioperative period, it is possible that increased release of incretin hormones such as GLP-1 may contribute to the improvement in glucose control. Complications depend on the approach. Mortality is low in experienced centres but post-operative respiratory problems, wound infection and dehiscence, staple leaks, stomal stenosis, marginal ulcers and venous thrombosis may occur. Additional problems may arise at a later stage, such as pouch and distal oesophageal dilatation, persistent vomiting, ‘dumping’ (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0150" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s1070">p. 801</ce:intra-ref>), hypoglycaemia and micronutrient deficiencies, particularly of folate, vitamin B<ce:inf loc="post">12</ce:inf> and iron, which are of special concern to women contemplating pregnancy; this should be delayed for at least 2 years following surgery.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0840">Cosmetic surgical procedures may be considered in obese patients after successful weight loss.

In advanced starvation, patients become completely inactive and may assume a flexed, fetal position. In the last stage of starvation, death comes quietly and often quite suddenly.

In the general UK population, 30% of those requiring acute admission to hospital show evidence of serious under-nutrition and 65% of those admitted will lose an average of 5% of their total body weight during that admission. In the older population, levels of under-nutrition and vitamin deficiencies parallel levels of independent living. In Scotland, 33% of those aged over 65 who are living in their own home are deficient in folic acid and 10% are deficient in vitamin C. The prevalence of vitamin deficiencies rises further in less independent groups in residential or nursing homes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1065">Under-nutrition is poorly recognised in hospitals and has serious consequences. Physical effects include impaired immunity and muscle weakness, which in turn affect cardiac and respiratory function, and delayed wound healing after surgery with increased risks of post-operative infection.

Much of this can be avoided through better awareness of the prevalence of under-nutrition, prompt nutritional assessment and monitoring with appropriate intervention.

Social isolation, low levels of disposable income and a lack of knowledge or interest in healthy eating may increase reliance on calorie-dense convenience foods of poor nutritional quality.

This must include consideration of the potential for disruption of the normal physiology of absorption and digestion in the context of the patient's medical and surgical history. Whenever possible, it is best to use the most physiological means of feeding, reserving more invasive interventions for when normal physiological mechanisms of swallowing and digestion are impaired or absent.

Rapid depletion of (already low) thiamin exacerbates the condition. Clinical features include nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, seizures, respiratory depression, cardiac arrest and sudden death. The risks of refeeding are greatest in those who are most malnourished (especially chronic alcoholics), but even those who have gone without food for 5 days can be at risk and restitution of feeding should always be done slowly, with careful monitoring of serum potassium, phosphate and magnesium in the first 3–5 days.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0305"><ce:section-title id="st0300">Oral nutritional supplements</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1215">Poor appetite, immobility, poor dentition or even being kept ‘nil by mouth’ for hospital procedures all contribute to weight loss. As a first step, patients should be encouraged and helped to eat an adequate amount of normal food. Where swallow and intestinal function remain intact, the simplest form of assisted nutrition is the use of oral nutritional supplements. Most branded products are nutritionally complete (fortified with the daily requirements of vitamins, minerals and trace elements). They most often come in the form of liquid drinks but various formulations and textures exist, including ‘shakes’ and ‘puddings’ with a thicker consistency. They are cost-effective and very useful for people who may require just a small number of additional calories each day to maintain or gain weight in the short or longer term.

Enteral tube feeding is usually the intervention of choice. In enteral feeding, nutrition is delivered to and absorbed by the functioning intestine. Delivery usually means bypassing the mouth and oesophagus (or sometimes the stomach and proximal small bowel) by means of a feeding tube (naso-enteral, gastrostomy or jejunostomy feeding). There are a number of theoretical advantages to enteral, as opposed to parenteral, feeding, which have achieved almost mythical status.

Insertion of a nasogastric tube requires care and training (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0180" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#b0220">Box 21.41</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0185" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s1250">p. 805</ce:intra-ref>), as potentially serious complications can arise (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9000" refid="b0100">Box 19.16</ce:cross-ref>). Patients with reduced conscious level may pull at tubes and displace them. This can be minimised in the short term by the use of a nasal ‘bridle’ device, which fixes the tube around the nasal septum. Although these devices are very effective, there is a risk of damage to the nasal septum (especially bleeding) if a patient persists in pulling forcibly on the tube.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0340"><ce:section-title id="st0335">Gastrostomy feeding</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1365">Gastrostomy is a more invasive insertion technique with higher costs initially. It is most suitable for when longer-term feeding (more than 4 weeks) is required. Gastrostomies are less liable to displacement than nasogastric tubes and the presence of the gastrostomy in the stomach allows for fewer feed interruptions, meaning that more of the prescribed feeds can be administered. Tubes were placed at the time of open surgery until the 1980s, when an endoscopic, minimally invasive technique was developed. A variety of techniques for radiological insertion have also been introduced subsequently. Both endoscopic and radiological gastrostomy insertion involve inflating the stomach, thus apposing it to the anterior abdominal wall. The stomach is then punctured percutaneously and a suitable tube placed (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0345" refid="f0075">Fig. 19.10</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0075"/>). Tubes vary in design but each has an internal retainer device (plastic ‘bumper’ or balloon) that sits snugly against the gastric mucosa, and an external retainer that limits movement. These retainers hold the gastric wall against the abdominal wall, effectively creating a controlled gastrocutaneous fistula that matures over 2–4 weeks. Radiological gastrostomy placement also utilises percutaneous ‘stay sutures’, which provide further temporary anchorage and assist in placement. There is no evidence to recommend one technique over another, although the radiological method has advantages in patients with cancers of the head and neck undergoing potentially curative therapy (less chance of tumour ‘seeding’) and in those with poor respiratory reserve (such as motor neuron disease) since there is no endoscope to compress the upper airways. Reported outcomes are broadly similar for both and the choice of technique should be based on indications and contraindications, operator experience and facilities available. Most important is rigorous patient assessment and selection prior to gastrostomy placement, which should be done by a multidisciplinary nutrition support team, and avoided when the procedure may be too hazardous or the benefits are outweighed by the risks (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0340" refid="b0110">Boxes 19.18</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0110"/> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0350" refid="b0155">Box 19.27</ce:cross-ref> below).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0345"><ce:section-title id="st0340">Post-pyloric feeding</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1370">In patients with a high risk of pulmonary aspiration or gastroparesis, it may be preferable to feed into the jejunum (via a nasojejunal tube, gastrostomy with jejunal extension or direct placement into jejunum by radiological, endoscopic or laparoscopic means).</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0350"><ce:section-title id="st0345">Parenteral nutrition</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1375">This is usually reserved for clinical situations where the absorptive functioning of the intestine is severely impaired.

Non-haem iron in cereals and vegetables is poorly absorbed but makes the greater contribution to overall intake, compared to the well-absorbed haem iron from animal products. Fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C enhance iron absorption, while the tannins in tea reduce it. Dietary calcium reduces iron uptake from the same meal, which may precipitate iron deficiency in those with borderline iron stores. There is no physiological mechanism for excretion of iron, so homeostasis depends on the regulation of iron absorption (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0335" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#f0115">Fig. 23.18</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0340" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#p3145">p. 942</ce:intra-ref>). This is regulated at the level of duodenal enterocytes by hepcidin (a peptide secreted by hepatocytes in the duodenum). The expression of hepcidin is suppressed when body iron is low, leading to enhanced efflux of iron into the circulation. The normal daily loss of iron is 1 mg, arising from desquamated surface cells and intestinal losses. A regular loss of only 2 mL of blood per day doubles the iron requirement. On average, an additional 20 mg of iron is lost during menstruation, so pre-menopausal women require about twice as much iron as men (and more if menstrual losses are heavy).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2355">The major consequence of iron deficiency is anaemia (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0345" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#p2970">p. 940</ce:intra-ref>). This is one of the most important nutritional causes of ill health in all parts of the world. In the UK, it is estimated that 10% women are iron-deficient. Dietary iron overload is occasionally observed and results in iron accumulation in the liver and, rarely, cirrhosis. Haemochromatosis results from an inherited increase in iron absorption (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0350" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00022-6#s1265">p. 895</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0560"><ce:section-title id="st0555">Iodine</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2360">Iodine is required for synthesis of thyroid hormones (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0355" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0085">p. 634</ce:intra-ref>). It is present in sea fish, seaweed and most plant foods grown near the sea. The amount of iodine in soil and water influences the iodine content of most foods. Iodine is lacking in the highest mountainous areas of the world (e.g. the Alps and the Himalayas) and in the soil of frequently flooded plains (e.g. Bangladesh).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2365">About a billion people in the world are estimated to have an inadequate iodine intake and hence are at risk of iodine deficiency disorder. Goitre is the most common manifestation, affecting about 200 million people (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0360" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#u0990">p. 648</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2370">In those areas where most women have endemic goitre, 1% or more of babies are born with cretinism (characterised by mental and physical retardation). There is a higher than usual prevalence of deafness, slowed reflexes and poor learning in the remaining population. The best way of preventing neonatal cretinism is to ensure adequate levels of iodine during pregnancy. This can be achieved by intramuscular injections with 1–2 mL of iodised poppy seed oil (475–950 mg iodine) to women of child-bearing age every 3–5 years, by administration of iodised oil orally at 6-monthly or yearly intervals to adults and children, or by provision of iodised salt for cooking.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0565"><ce:section-title id="st0560">Zinc</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2375">Zinc is present in most foods of vegetable and animal origin.

Chronic zinc deficiency occurs in dietary deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism and its associated hepatic cirrhosis. It causes the clinical features seen in the very rare congenital disorder known as acrodermatitis enteropathica (growth retardation, hair loss and chronic diarrhoea). Zinc deficiency is thought to be responsible for one-third of the world's population not reaching their optimal height. In the Middle East, chronic deficiency has been associated with dwarfism and hypogonadism. In starvation, zinc deficiency causes thymic atrophy; zinc supplements may accelerate the healing of skin lesions, promote general well-being, improve appetite and reduce the morbidity associated with the under-nourished state, and lower the mortality associated with diarrhoea and pneumonia in children.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0570"><ce:section-title id="st0565">Selenium</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2385">The family of seleno-enzymes includes glutathione peroxidase, which helps prevent free radical damage to cells, and mono­deiodinase, which converts thyroxine to triiodothyronine (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0365" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0085">p. 634</ce:intra-ref>).

Soft waters usually contain no fluoride, while very hard waters may contain over 10 ppm. The benefit of fluoride is greatest when it is taken before the permanent teeth erupt, while their enamel is being laid down. The addition of traces of fluoride (at 1 ppm) to public water supplies is now a widespread practice. Chronic fluoride poisoning is occasionally seen where the water supply contains &#x003E; 10 ppm fluoride. It can also occur in workers handling cryolite (aluminium sodium fluoride), used in smelting aluminium. Fluoride poisoning is described on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0370" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00007-X#s0485">page 149</ce:intra-ref>.
