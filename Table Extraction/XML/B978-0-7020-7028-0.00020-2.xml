Histology is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0145" refid="f0060">Figure 20.6</ce:cross-ref>. <ce:bold>B</ce:bold> The core of each islet consists of β cells that produce insulin, and is surrounded by a cortex of endocrine cells that produce other hormones, including glucagon (α cells), somatostatin (δ cells) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP cells). <ce:bold>C</ce:bold> Schematic representation of the pancreatic β cell. (1) Glucose enters the cell via a glucose transporter (GLUT1 or GLUT2). (2) Glucose then enters glycolysis, and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria results in a rise in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). (3) This ATP acts to close the K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf> channel (which consists of four KIR6.2 subunits and four SUR1 subunits). This leads to membrane depolarisation. (4) The rise in membrane potential results in calcium influx due to opening of a voltage-gated calcium channel. This rise in intracellular calcium causes insulin secretory vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane, leading to insulin secretion. (5) Other stimuli, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), act on G-protein-coupled receptors to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and amplify the insulin secretion. Genetic defects in the β cell result in diabetes. The primary genes are glucokinase (the initial step in glycolysis) and <ce:italic>HNF1α</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>HNF4α</ce:italic> and <ce:italic>HNF1β</ce:italic> (nuclear transcription factors). Two groups of drugs act on the β cell to promote insulin secretion. Sulphonylureas act to close the K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf> channel, causing membrane depolarisation, calcium influx and insulin secretion. Incretin-acting drugs either increase the concentration of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP (the dipeptidyl peptidase 4, or DPP-4, inhibitors) or act as directly on the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 receptor agonists). Both of these drug groups act to augment insulin secretion but only following an initial stimulus to insulin secretion through closure of β cell K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf> channels by glucose (or sulphonylureas).</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0015" role="short">Fig. 20.2</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0050" locator="f020-002-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000202/f020-002-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0045"><ce:label>Fig. 20.3</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0040"><ce:simple-para id="sp0050" role="title">Insulin secretion in response to intravenous or oral glucose.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0055" role="caption"><ce:bold>A</ce:bold> An acute first phase of insulin secretion occurs in response to an elevated blood glucose, followed by a sustained second phase. <ce:bold>B</ce:bold> The incretin effect describes the observation that insulin secretion is greater when glucose is given by mouth than when glucose is administered intravenously to achieve the same rise in blood glucose concentrations.

In response to a rise in blood glucose, e.g. after a meal, insulin is released, suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis and storage. Insulin promotes the peripheral uptake of glucose, particularly in skeletal muscle, and encourages storage (as muscle glycogen). It also promotes protein synthesis and lipogenesis, and suppresses lipolysis. The release of intermediate metabolites, including amino acids (glutamine, alanine), 3-carbon intermediates in oxidation (lactate, pyruvate) and free fatty acids (FFAs), is controlled by insulin. In the absence of insulin, e.g. during fasting, these processes are reversed and favour gluconeogenesis in liver from glycogen, glycerol, amino acids and other 3-carbon precursors.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0030" role="short">Fig. 20.5</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0065" locator="f020-005-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000202/f020-005-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0060"><ce:label>Fig. 20.6</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0055"><ce:simple-para id="sp0085" role="title">Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0090" role="caption">Proposed sequence of events in the development of type 1 diabetes.

It has many causes (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0125" refid="b0070">Box 20.9</ce:cross-ref>), most commonly type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is generally considered to result from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells (β cells) in the pancreas, leading to marked insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes is characterised by reduced sensitivity to the action of insulin and an inability to produce sufficient insulin to overcome this ‘insulin resistance’. Hyperglycaemia causes both acute and long-term problems. Acutely, high glucose and lack of insulin can result in marked symptoms, metabolic decompensation and hospitalisation. Chronic hyperglycaemia is responsible for diabetes-specific ‘microvascular’ complications affecting the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy) and feet (neuropathy).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0325">There is a continuous distribution of blood glucose in the population, with no clear division between people with normal values and those with abnormal ones. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes (a fasting plasma glucose of ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or glucose 2 hours after an oral glucose challenge of ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); p. 726) have been selected to identify a degree of hyperglycaemia that, if untreated, carries a significant risk of microvascular disease, and in particular diabetic retinopathy. Less severe hyperglycaemia is called ‘impaired glucose tolerance’. This is not associated with a substantial risk of microvascular disease, but is connected with an increased risk of large-vessel disease (e.g. atheroma leading to myocardial infarction) and with a greater risk of developing diabetes in future.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0330">The incidence of diabetes is rising. Globally, it is estimated that 415 million people had diabetes in 2015 (10% of the world adult population), and this figure is expected to reach 642 million by 2040. This global pandemic principally involves type 2 diabetes; prevalence varies considerably around the world (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0130" refid="f0035">Fig. 20.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0035"/>), being associated with differences in genetic factors, as well as environmental ones such as greater longevity, obesity, unsatisfactory diet, sedentary lifestyle, increasing urbanisation and economic development. A pronounced rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes occurs in migrant populations to industrialised countries, as in Asian and Afro-Caribbean immigrants to the UK or USA. Type 2 diabetes is now seen in children and adolescents, particularly in some ethnic groups such as Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks and Asian Indians.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0335">The incidence of type 1 diabetes is also increasing: between 1960 and 1996, 3% more children were diagnosed worldwide each year. It is generally more common in countries closer to the polar regions. Finland, for instance, has the highest rate of type 1 diagnosis per year at &#x003E; 60 per 100 000 of the population, whereas in China, India and Venezuela the incidence is only 0.1 per 100 000. Type 1 diabetes is most common in Caucasians, and more people are diagnosed in the winter months.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0340">Diabetes is a major burden on health-care facilities in all countries. Globally, in 2015, diabetes caused 5 million deaths in those aged 20–79 years, and health-care expenditure attributed to diabetes was estimated to be at least 673 billion US dollars, or 12% of total health-care expenditure.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section id="s0070"><ce:section-title id="st0065">Regulation of insulin secretion</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0345">Insulin is the primary regulator of glucose metabolism and storage (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0135" refid="b0030">Box 20.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0030"/>), and is secreted from pancreatic β cells into the portal circulation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0140" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0040"/>). The pancreatic β cell is designed to regulate blood glucose concentrations tightly by coupling glucose and other nutrient stimuli with insulin secretion (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0150" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2</ce:cross-ref>). Entry of glucose into the pancreatic β cell is by facilitated diffusion down its concentration gradient through cell membrane glucose transporters (GLUTs). Glucose is then metabolised by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The first step of the glycolytic pathway, the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, is catalysed by the enzyme glucokinase (GK). Glucokinase has a low affinity for glucose and so its activity under normal physiological conditions varies markedly, according to the concentration of glucose. This makes it a very effective glucose sensor in the β cell. In what is considered a classical direct or triggering pathway, glucose metabolism results in increased intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which causes closure of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf>). The resulting membrane depolarisation of the β cell results in insulin secretion due to triggering of calcium release by voltage-sensitive calcium channels. In addition to this pathway, the amount of insulin released can be amplified or potentiated by the background blood glucose, other nutrients and peptides, and by neuronal control via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. A good example of this potentiation of insulin release is seen with the secretion of two gut peptides following ingestion of food. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) are released from gastrointestinal L cells and K cells, respectively, following a meal, and act via receptors on the pancreatic β cells to augment insulin secretion. Thus, for a given glucose stimulus to the β cell, there is greater insulin secretion with oral glucose administration (where the gut peptides are released) compared to intravenous glucose administration (which does not stimulate gut peptide release). This enhanced insulin secretion following oral administration of glucose is termed the ‘incretin’ effect (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0155" refid="f0045">Fig. 20.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0045"/>), and GLP-1 and GIP are known as incretin hormones.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0355">Insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone (pro-insulin) that consists of an α and a β chain, which are linked by C-peptide (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0160" refid="f0050">Fig. 20.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0050"/>). The C-peptide is cleaved by β-cell peptidases to create insulin (which now consists of the α and β chains) and free C-peptide. Insulin secretion in response to a glucose stimulus classically occurs in two phases (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0165" refid="f0045">Fig. 20.3</ce:cross-ref>). The rapid first phase represents the secretion of pre-formed insulin from granules within the β cells, while the more prolonged second phase is a consequence of newly synthesised insulin.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0075"><ce:section-title id="st0070">Regulation of glucagon secretion</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0360">Pancreatic islets also contain other endocrine cells such as α cells that secrete the peptide hormone glucagon, and δ cells that produce somatostatin (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0170" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2B</ce:cross-ref>). Alpha cells make up about 20% of the human islet cell population. Glucagon has opposite effects to insulin and acts on the liver (and kidney) to stimulate glycogenolysis, leading to increased hepatic glucose production. Regulation of glucagon secretion by the α cell is complex, but β-cell insulin secretion, co-secreted zinc and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as somatostatin from δ cells, are thought to have major regulatory roles. This means that insulin and glucagon are tightly, and reciprocally, regulated, such that the ratio of insulin to glucagon in the portal vein is a major determinant of hepatic glucose production. Glucagon is also critically important to the body's defence against hypoglycaemia (p. 738).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0080"><ce:section-title id="st0075">Blood glucose homeostasis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0365">Blood glucose is tightly regulated and maintained within a narrow range. This is essential for ensuring a continuous supply of glucose to the central nervous system. The brain has little capacity to store energy in the form of glycogen or triglyceride, and the blood–brain barrier is largely impermeable to fatty acids, so the brain depends on the liver for a constant supply of glucose for oxidation and hence generation of ATP. Glucose homeostasis is achieved through the coordinated actions of multiple organs, but mainly reflects a balance between the entry of glucose into the circulation from the liver, supplemented by intestinal absorption of glucose after meals, and the uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle and brain.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0370">After ingestion of a meal containing carbohydrate, normal blood glucose levels are maintained by:<ce:list id="ulist0090"><ce:list-item id="u0255"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0375">suppression of hepatic glucose production</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0260"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0380">stimulation of hepatic glucose uptake</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0265"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0385">stimulation of glucose uptake by peripheral tissues (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0175" refid="f0055">Fig. 20.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0055"/>).</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para id="p0390">The post-prandial rise in portal vein insulin and glucose, together with a fall in portal glucagon concentrations, suppresses hepatic glucose production and results in net hepatic glucose uptake.

In addition, insulin stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and fat, mediated by the glucose transporter GLUT4.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0395">When intestinal glucose absorption declines between meals, portal vein insulin and glucose concentrations fall while glucagon levels rise. This leads to increased hepatic glucose output via gluconeogenesis and glycogen breakdown. The liver now resumes net glucose production and glucose homeostasis is maintained.

Insulin is the major regulator not only of glucose metabolism but also of fatty acid metabolism. High insulin levels after meals promote triglyceride accumulation. In contrast, in the fasting state, low insulin levels permit lipolysis and the release into the circulation of FFAs (and glycerol), which can be oxidised by many tissues. Their partial oxidation in the liver provides energy to drive gluconeogenesis and also produces ketone bodies (acetoacetate, which can be reduced to 3-hydroxybutyrate or decarboxylated to acetone), which are generated in hepatocyte mitochondria. Ketone bodies are organic acids that, when formed in small amounts, are oxidised and utilised as metabolic fuel. However, the rate of utilisation of ketone bodies by peripheral tissues is limited, and when the rate of production by the liver exceeds their removal, hyperketonaemia results. This occurs physiologically during starvation, when low insulin levels and high catecholamine levels increase lipolysis and delivery of FFAs to the liver.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0090"><ce:section-title id="st0085">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0095"><ce:section id="s0100"><ce:section-title id="st0090">Urine glucose</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0405">Testing the urine for glucose with dipsticks is a common screening procedure for detecting diabetes. If possible, testing should be performed on urine passed 1–2 hours after a meal to maximise sensitivity. Glycosuria always warrants further assessment by blood testing (see below). The greatest disadvantage of urine glucose measurement is the individual variation in renal threshold for glucose. The most frequent cause of glycosuria is a low renal threshold, which is common during pregnancy and in young people; the resulting ‘renal glycosuria’ is a benign condition unrelated to diabetes. Another disadvantage is that some drugs (such as β-lactam antibiotics, levodopa and salicylates) may interfere with urine glucose tests.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0105"><ce:section-title id="st0095">Blood glucose</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0410">Laboratory glucose testing in blood relies on an enzymatic reaction (glucose oxidase) and is cheap, usually automated and highly reliable.

These devices are not as accurate as blood glucose testing, particularly when levels are low or changing rapidly, so users must still check blood glucose with a glucose meter before driving or changing therapy.

Ketonuria is therefore not pathognomonic of diabetes but, if it is associated with glycosuria, the diagnosis of diabetes is highly likely. Urine ketone measurements are semi-quantitative, awkward to perform and retrospective (i.e. the urine has accumulated over several hours). Also, they do not measure the major ketone found in blood during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB). Beta-OHB can be measured in blood in the laboratory and also in a fingerprick specimen of capillary blood with a test stick and electronic meter. Whole-blood β-OHB monitoring is useful in assisting with insulin adjustment during intercurrent illness or sustained hyperglycaemia to prevent or detect DKA.

If islet autoantibodies are present at high titre, this can be supportive of a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The antibodies that are measured are directed against components of the islet and consist of antibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), protein tyrosine phosphatase-related proteins (IA-2) and the zinc transporter ZnT8. These antibodies can be detected in the general population; the level at which they are called positive does vary by laboratory but is usually at concentrations greater than the 95th centile or 97.5th centile of the general population. This means that pancreatic autoantibodies can be weakly positive in people who do not have type 1 diabetes. However, if anti-GAD and anti-IA-2 antibodies are measured together, they will be ‘positive’ (alone or in combination) in approximately 85% of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

However, the underlying genes, precipitating environmental factors and pathophysiology differ substantially between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes was previously termed ‘insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus’ (IDDM) and is invariably associated with insulin deficiency requiring replacement therapy. Type 2 diabetes was previously termed ‘non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus’ (NIDDM) because patients retain the capacity to secrete insulin, and measured insulin levels are often higher than those seen in people without diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, though, there is an impaired sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and, initially, affected individuals can usually be treated without insulin replacement therapy. However, 20% or more of patients with type 2 diabetes will ultimately develop insulin deficiency requiring replacement therapy, so IDDM and NIDDM were misnomers.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0175"><ce:section id="s0180"><ce:section-title id="st0165">Type 1 diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0185"><ce:section-title id="st0170">Pathology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0610">Type 1 diabetes is generally considered a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0095" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00004-4#s0470">p. 81</ce:intra-ref>) involving destruction of the insulin-secreting β cells in the pancreatic islets. The natural history of type 1 diabetes is based on the model proposed by Eisenbarth in 1986, which proposed that genetically susceptible individuals with a given β-cell mass who were subsequently exposed to an environmental trigger then developed β-cell autoimmunity that led to progressive loss of β cells. This process was seen to take place over a prolonged period (months to years). Marked hyperglycaemia, accompanied by the classical symptoms of diabetes, occurs only when 80–90% of the functional capacity of β cells has been lost. More recent data have led to modifications of this model. For example, it is now recognised that pancreatic β cells can persist in some individuals with very long-standing diabetes and may never reach zero. On the contrary, some individuals present with much higher levels of β-cell viability (40–50%) and that may reflect lower levels of physical activity or increased body mass. Despite this uncertainty, in the natural history of type 1 diabetes there is initially a loss of first-phase insulin secretion, followed by a period of glucose intolerance and clinically undiagnosed diabetes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0615">The pathology in the pre-diabetic pancreas is characterised by an inflammatory lesion within islets, ‘insulitis’ (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0235" refid="f0060">Fig. 20.6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0060"/>), with infiltration of the islets by mononuclear cells containing activated macrophages, helper cytotoxic and suppressor T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and B lymphocytes. Initially, these lesions are patchy and, until a very late stage, lobules containing heavily infiltrated islets are seen adjacent to unaffected lobules. The destructive process is β-cell-specific. It is unclear why other hormone-secreting cells in the islets, such as α and δ cells, remain intact. In addition, while a number of theories such as molecular mimicry, oxidative stress and viral infections have been proposed, the specific mechanisms for inducing autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes are unknown.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0620">Autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes is identified by the presence of autoantibodies to islet and/or β-cell antigens.

In the USA, the risk of developing type 1 diabetes is 1 : 20 for those with a first-degree relative, compared with a 1 : 300 risk in the general population.

Potential candidates fall into three main categories: viruses, specific drugs or chemicals, and dietary constituents. Viruses implicated in the aetiology of type 1 diabetes include mumps, Coxsackie B4, retroviruses, rubella (in utero), cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus. Various dietary nitrosamines (found in smoked and cured meats) and coffee have been proposed as potentially diabetogenic toxins. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), a major constituent of cow's milk, has been implicated, since children who are given cow's milk early in infancy are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than those who are breastfed. BSA may cross the neonatal gut and raise antibodies that cross-react with a heat-shock protein expressed by β cells. It has also been proposed that reduced exposure to microorganisms in early childhood limits maturation of the immune system and increases susceptibility to autoimmune disease (the ‘hygiene hypothesis’).

It is also possible for patients who have a more insidious onset of diabetes to have an autoimmune aetiology; these people are sometimes described as having slow-onset type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA). LADA is defined as the presence of islet autoantibodies in high titre (usually GAD antibodies), without rapid progression to insulin therapy (which would usually signify type 1 diabetes). Patients with LADA can often present and be managed similarly to those with type 2 diabetes, but they do progress more rapidly to requiring insulin treatment for glucose control.

The natural history of typical type 2 diabetes is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0260" refid="f0070">Figure 20.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0070"/>. Initially, insulin resistance leads to elevated insulin secretion in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels. However, in susceptible individuals, the pancreatic β cells are unable to sustain the increased demand for insulin and a slowly progressive insulin deficiency develops. Some patients develop diabetes at a young age, usually driven by insulin resistance due to obesity and ethnicity; others, particularly older patients, develop diabetes despite being non-obese and may have more pronounced β-cell failure. The key feature is a ‘relative’ insulin deficiency, such that there is insufficient insulin production to overcome the resistance to insulin action. This contrasts with type 1 diabetes, in which there is rapid loss of insulin production, resulting in ketoacidosis and death if the insulin is not replaced.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0220"><ce:section-title id="st0205">Insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0665">Type 2 diabetes and its pre-diabetes antecedents belong to a cluster of conditions thought to be caused by resistance to insulin action. Thus, people with type 2 diabetes often have associated disorders including hypertension, dyslipidaemia (characterised by elevated levels of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0145" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00022-6#s0840">p. 882</ce:intra-ref>) and, in women, polycystic ovarian syndrome. This cluster has been termed the ‘insulin resistance syndrome’ or ‘metabolic syndrome’, and is much more common in individuals who are obese.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0670">The primary cause of insulin resistance remains unclear; it is likely that there are multiple defects in insulin signalling, affecting several tissues. One theory is centred around the adipocyte; this is particularly appealing, as obesity is a major cause of increased insulin resistance. Intra-abdominal ‘central’ adipose tissue is metabolically active and releases large quantities of FFAs, which may induce insulin resistance because they compete with glucose as a fuel supply for oxidation in peripheral tissues such as muscle. In addition, adipose tissue releases a number of hormones (including a variety of peptides, called ‘adipokines’ because they are structurally similar to immunological ‘cytokines’) that act on specific receptors to influence sensitivity to insulin in other tissues. Because the venous drainage of visceral adipose tissue is into the portal vein, central obesity may have a particularly potent influence on insulin sensitivity in the liver, and thereby adversely affect gluconeogenesis and hepatic lipid metabolism.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0675">Physical activity is another important determinant of insulin sensitivity. Inactivity is associated with down-regulation of insulin-sensitive kinases and may promote accumulation of FFAs within skeletal muscle. Sedentary people are therefore more insulin-resistant than active people with the same degree of obesity. Moreover, physical activity allows non-insulin-dependent glucose uptake into muscle, reducing the ‘demand’ on the pancreatic β cells to produce insulin.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0680">Deposition of fat in the liver is a common association with central obesity and is exacerbated by insulin resistance and/or deficiency.

Some pathological changes are typical of type 2 diabetes, the most consistent of which is deposition of amyloid in the islets. In addition, elevated plasma glucose and FFAs exert toxic effects on pancreatic β cells to impair insulin secretion. However, while β-cell numbers are reduced, α-cell mass is unchanged and glucagon secretion is increased, which may contribute to hyperglycaemia.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0230"><ce:section-title id="st0215">Genetic predisposition</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0690">Genetic factors are important in type 2 diabetes, as shown by marked differences in susceptibility in different ethnic groups and by studies in monozygotic twins where concordance rates for type 2 diabetes approach 100%.

Genome-wide association studies have identified over 70 genes or gene regions that are associated with type 2 diabetes, each exerting a small effect. Most of the genes known to contribute to risk of type 2 diabetes are involved in β-cell function or in regulation of cell cycling and turnover, suggesting that altered regulation of β-cell mass is a key factor. The largest population genetic effect described to date is seen with variation in <ce:italic>TCF7L2</ce:italic>; the 10% of the population with two copies of the risk variant for this gene have a nearly twofold increase in risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In general, other common variants explain much lower risk than this, many explaining less than a 10% increase in risk only; as only about 10% of the genetic variance in type 2 diabetes is explained by these common genetic variants, this has led some to question the relevance of finding diabetes genes. However, it should be noted that, within a population, the distribution of risk variants will vary, with some patients having inherited a high genetic burden (e.g. more than 40 risk variants) and others having inherited very few. When studies compare those in the top 20% of this risk band with the lowest 20%, those at highest risk are over 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes. More recent insights into the genetics of type 2 diabetes have highlighted how some genetic variants may be rare and therefore affect only a small proportion of the population, but have large clinical effects. For example, in a Greenlandic population, 3% of people carry a homozygous variant in an insulin signalling gene, <ce:italic>TBC1D4</ce:italic>, that results in muscle insulin resistance; these individuals are over 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0235"><ce:section-title id="st0220">Environmental and other risk factors</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0240"><ce:section-title id="st0225">Diet and obesity</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0700">Epidemiological studies show that type 2 diabetes is associated with overeating, especially when combined with obesity and under-activity.

Relatively small amounts of insulin are required to suppress lipolysis, and some glucose uptake is maintained in muscle so that, in contrast to type 1 diabetes, lipolysis and proteolysis are not unrestrained and weight loss and ketoacidosis seldom occur. In type 2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia tends to develop slowly over months or years; because of this insidious onset many cases of type 2 diabetes are discovered coincidentally and a large number are undetected. At diagnosis, patients are often asymptomatic or give a long history (typically many months) of fatigue, with or without ‘osmotic symptoms’ (thirst and polyuria). However, there are some people with type 2 diabetes who present acutely with marked osmotic symptoms and weight loss. These may be presenting late, such that they have already developed β-cell failure, but more usually this decompensation reflects a vicious spiral of decline. As hyperglycaemia worsens, patients often crave sugar and will consume large volumes of sugary drinks to try to quench their thirst; worsening hyperglycaemia is also associated with increasing lipolysis, and the high circulating glucose and FFAs are toxic to the β cell, resulting in ‘glucolipotoxicity’ and reduced β-cell function. In these patients, ketosis and even DKA can occur; this is classically described in the African American population, where up to half of patients who present with DKA have type 2 diabetes and not type 1 diabetes. The presentation of DKA in type 2 diabetes is referred to as ‘ketosis-prone’ diabetes or ‘Flatbush syndrome’, named after the Flatbush neighbourhood of New York, which had a large Caribbean population and where presentation with DKA was common.

One form is caused by mutations in glucokinase (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0315" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2B</ce:cross-ref>); this is the pancreatic glucose sensor and patients with glucokinase mutations have an altered set-point for glucose. This results in a high fasting glucose (usually &#x003E; 5.5 mmol/L (99 mg/dL)) but a normal post-prandial response. As a result, patients with glucokinase MODY have stable, mild hyperglycaemia, with only a slightly elevated HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf>; they do not require treatment and do not develop diabetes complications. It is therefore important to identify these patients, to avoid unnecessary diabetes treatment and monitoring. The other forms of MODY are mostly caused by defective transcription factors that play a key role in pancreatic β-cell development and function (hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α, 1β and 4α). Patients with transcription factor MODY develop diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood and the diabetes is progressive, requiring oral diabetes treatment before eventually needing insulin. Patients with HNF1α and 4α MODY are extremely sensitive to sulphonylureas and this is the treatment of choice for these individuals. HNF1β is a critical transcription factor not only in pancreatic development but also in renal and genital tract development in utero. Patients with <ce:italic>HNF1β</ce:italic> mutations usually have renal abnormalities, including renal cystic disease and genital tract malformation, such as absent or bicornuate uterus or hypospadias and infertility; about 50% of individuals with the gene mutation have young-onset diabetes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0870">Neonatal diabetes is variably defined as diabetes that presents in the neonatal period, although this is usually extended to the first 6 months of life. The presentation is usually that of profound insulin deficiency with marked hyperglycaemia and DKA. Approximately half of patients with neonatal diabetes have a transient form that remits by about 1 year of age, with diabetes recurring in adolescence or early adulthood; the remaining patients have permanent neonatal diabetes. In recent years, the genetics of neonatal diabetes have been unravelled, having a major positive impact for people with this condition. Approximately two-thirds of patients with permanent neonatal diabetes have an activating mutation in the genes encoding the KIR6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf> channel (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0320" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2C</ce:cross-ref>). These mutations cause the K<ce:inf loc="post">ATP</ce:inf> channel to be insensitive to the glucose-mediated rise in intracellular ATP; as a result, the pancreatic β cells do not secrete insulin and patients require insulin treatment from soon after birth. It has been shown, however, that these individuals do respond to sulphonylureas; this finding has transformed their care, over 90% being managed with oral sulphonylurea treatment.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0290"><ce:section-title id="st0270">Presenting problems in diabetes mellitus</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0295"><ce:section-title id="st0275">Hyperglycaemia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0875">The diagnosis of diabetes is simple: it is based on confirmation of hyperglycaemia using either fasting or random glucose, an OGTT or HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> (p. 727). Diabetes, however, results from a variety of pathological processes, meaning that within this broad category are many aetiological subtypes. Following the identification of hyperglycaemia and subsequent diagnosis of diabetes, the initial management involves a careful clinical assessment of the patient to decide whether immediate treatment is required and, with appropriate investigation, to establish the aetiology of the diabetes, as this will determine subsequent diabetes treatment (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0325" refid="f0075">Fig. 20.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0075"/>). The main differential diagnosis to consider is that of type 1 or type 2 diabetes; making a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is important, as a failure to initiate insulin treatment can result in the development of DKA and death. If the aetiological diagnosis is in doubt, it is important not to delay insulin treatment, which can be withdrawn subsequently if necessary.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0880">Hyperglycaemia causes a wide variety of symptoms (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0330" refid="b0080">Box 20.11</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0080"/>).

Symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia and rapid weight loss are prominent in type 1 diabetes but are often absent in patients with type 2 diabetes, many of whom are asymptomatic or have non-specific complaints such as chronic fatigue and malaise. Uncontrolled diabetes is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection and patients may present with skin sepsis (boils) or genital candidiasis, and complain of pruritus vulvae or balanitis.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0950">While the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes is usually obvious, overlap occurs, particularly in age at onset, duration of symptoms and family history. There are many patients in whom the type of diabetes is not immediately apparent. For example, patients with type 2 diabetes may present with marked and rapid weight loss and even DKA (10–15% of all cases of DKA), and type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children and young adults. Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, not just in younger people, and may develop more insidiously; the presence of pancreatic autoantibodies confirms the diagnosis of slow-onset type 1 diabetes or LADA. Islet autoantibodies are detectable at high titre in many patients with type 1 diabetes, so a negative result should prompt consideration of other aetiologies. Other causes of diabetes (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0340" refid="b0070">Box 20.9</ce:cross-ref>), such as MODY, should not be forgotten, particularly in those presenting in childhood or as young adults. A history of pancreatic disease, particularly in patients with a history of alcohol excess, makes insulin deficiency more likely. Sometimes the definitive classification of the type of diabetes is only made later, once the natural history or responsiveness to different therapies becomes apparent.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0955">Physical signs in patients with type 2 diabetes at diagnosis depend on the mode of presentation. In Western populations, more than 80% are overweight and the obesity is often central (truncal or abdominal). Obesity is much less evident in Asians. Hypertension is present in at least 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Although dyslipidaemia is also common, skin lesions such as xanthelasma and eruptive xanthomas are rare.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0300"><ce:section-title id="st0280">Presentation with the complications of diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0960">Patients with long-standing diabetes are at risk of developing a variety of complications (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0345" refid="b0200">Box 20.35</ce:cross-ref>, p. 756) and as many as 25% of people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of diabetic complications at the time of diagnosis. Thus, diabetes may be first suspected when a patient visits an optometrist or podiatrist, or presents with hypertension or a vascular event such as an acute myocardial infarction or stroke.

Mortality is low in the UK (approximately 2%) but remains high in developing countries and among non-hospitalised patients.

However, an increasing number of patients presenting with DKA have underlying type 2 diabetes. This appears to be particularly prevalent in black, Asian and Hispanic populations. In established type 1 diabetes, DKA may be precipitated by an intercurrent illness because of failure to increase insulin dose appropriately to compensate for the stress response. Sometimes, there is no evidence of a precipitating infection and DKA develops because of errors in self-management.

Ketosis stems from insulin deficiency, exacerbated by elevated catecholamines and other stress hormones, leading to unrestrained lipolysis and supply of FFAs for hepatic ketogenesis. When this exceeds the capacity to metabolise acidic ketones, these accumulate in blood. The resulting metabolic acidosis forces hydrogen ions into cells, displacing potassium ions.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1000">The average loss of fluid and electrolytes in moderately severe DKA in an adult is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0360" refid="b0090">Box 20.13</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0090"/>. About half the deficit of total body water is derived from the intracellular compartment and occurs comparatively early in the development of acidosis with relatively few clinical features; the remainder represents loss of extracellular fluid sustained largely in the later stages, when marked contraction of extracellular fluid volume occurs, with haemoconcentration, a decreased blood volume, and finally a fall in blood pressure with associated renal ischaemia and oliguria.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1010">Every patient in DKA is potassium-depleted but the plasma concentration of potassium gives very little indication of the total body deficit.

Exceptionally, if intravenous administration is not feasible, soluble insulin can be given by intramuscular injection (loading dose of 10–20 U, followed by 5 U hourly), or a fast-acting insulin analogue can be given hourly by subcutaneous injection (initially 0.3 U/kg body weight, then 0.1 U/kg hourly). The blood glucose concentration should fall by 3–6 mmol/L (approximately 55–110 mg/dL) per hour, or blood ketone concentrations fall by at least 0.5 mmol/L/hr. A more rapid decrease in blood glucose should be avoided, as this might precipitate hypoglycaemia and the serious complication of cerebral oedema, particularly in children. Failure of blood glucose to fall within 1 hour of commencing insulin infusion should lead to a re-assessment of insulin dose. Ketosis, dehydration, acidaemia, infection and stress combine to produce severe insulin resistance in some cases, but most will respond to a low-dose insulin regimen. When the blood glucose has fallen, 10% dextrose infusion is introduced and insulin infusion continued to encourage glucose uptake into cells and restoration of normal metabolism. In recent years, it has also become increasingly common to continue with the use of long-acting insulin analogues administered subcutaneously during the initial management of DKA; this provides background insulin for when the intravenous insulin is discontinued, to reduce the risk of in-hospital DKA.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1430">Restoration of the usual insulin regimen, by subcutaneous injection, should not be instituted until the patient is both biochemically stable and able to eat and drink normally.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0370"><ce:section-title id="st0350">Fluid replacement</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1435">In adults, rapid fluid replacement in the first few hours is usually recommended (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0385" refid="b0105">Box 20.16</ce:cross-ref>).

The reason that patients with HHS do not develop significant ketoacidosis is unclear, although it has been speculated that insulin levels may be too low to stimulate glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues, but are still sufficient to prevent lipolysis and subsequent ketogenesis. A mixed picture of HHS and DKA can occur.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1470">Although typically occurring in older patients, HHS is increasingly seen in younger adults.

Comorbidities also need to be taken into account; for example, rapid fluid replacement may precipitate cardiac failure in patients with coronary artery disease. Historically, management of HHS has followed DKA guidelines, but increasing recognition of the differences between HHS and DKA has led to new approaches in HHS. In particular, rapid shifts in osmolality should be avoided through more measured fluid replacement regimens that are guided by serial calculations of serum osmolality.

High glucose levels in the morning are not, as commonly perceived, an indicator of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1945">Exercise-induced hypoglycaemia occurs in people with well-controlled, insulin-treated diabetes because of hyperinsulinaemia. Suppression of endogenous insulin secretion to allow increased hepatic glucose production to meet the increased metabolic demand is key to the normal physiological response to exercise. In insulin-treated diabetes, insulin levels may actually increase with exercise because of improved blood flow at the site of injection, and this increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. This means that both insulin and muscle contraction will increase glucose uptake, causing a fall in blood glucose. This occurs most commonly with prolonged and/or aerobic exercise. In addition, the ‘double hit’ of hypoglycaemia with exercise reflects the additional increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia that can occur after exercise, possibly as a result of glycogen depletion. In contrast, high-intensity exercise because of the marked stimulation to adrenaline (epinephrine) production may actually cause blood glucose to rise significantly. Education is key to preventing exercise-induced hypoglycaemia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1950">Hypoglycaemia may also occur within the hospital setting. This may result from errors in insulin dose or type of insulin prescribed, infusion of IV insulin without glucose, changes in meal timings or content and failure to provide usual snacks, reduced carbohydrate intake because of vomiting or reduced appetite, or factors related to the hospital admission, e.g. concurrent illness or discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0455"><ce:section-title id="st0435">Awareness of hypoglycaemia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1955">For most individuals, the glucose level (threshold) at which they first become aware of hypoglycaemia is not constant but varies according to the circumstances in which hypoglycaemia arises (e.g. during the night or during exercise). In addition, with longer duration of disease, and particularly in response to frequent hypoglycaemia, the threshold for generation of symptom responses to hypoglycaemia shifts to a lower glucose concentration. This cerebral adaptation has a similar effect on the counter-regulatory hormonal response to hypoglycaemia. Taken together, this means that individuals with type 1 diabetes may have reduced (impaired) awareness of hypoglycaemia. Symptoms can be experienced less intensely, or even be absent, despite blood glucose concentrations below 3.0 mmol/L (55 mg/dL). Such individuals are at an especially high risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The prevalence of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia increases with time; overall, it affects around 20–25% of people with type 1 diabetes and under 10% with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0460"><ce:section-title id="st0440">Management</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0465"><ce:section-title id="st0445">Acute treatment of hypoglycaemia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1960">Treatment of hypoglycaemia depends on its severity and on whether the patient is conscious and able to swallow (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0420" refid="b0125">Box 20.20</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0125"/>).

When hypoglycaemia has occurred in a patient treated with a long- or intermediate-acting insulin or a long-acting sulphonylurea, such as glibenclamide, the possibility of recurrence should be anticipated; to prevent this, infusion of 10% dextrose, titrated to the patient's blood glucose, or provision of additional carbohydrate may be necessary.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2055">If the patient fails to regain consciousness after blood glucose is restored to normal, then cerebral oedema and other causes of impaired consciousness – such as alcohol intoxication, a post-ictal state or cerebral haemorrhage – should be considered.

Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the insulin regimen in use by the patient will help prevent further hypoglycaemia (p. 748). For example, an individual experiencing regular nocturnal hypoglycaemia between midnight and 0200 hrs may be found to be taking twice-daily soluble and intermediate-acting insulins before breakfast and before the main evening meal between 1700 and 1900 hrs. In this case, the peak action of the isophane insulin will coincide with the period of maximum sensitivity to insulin – namely, 2300–0200 hrs – and increase the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. To address this, the evening dose of depot intermediate-acting insulin should be deferred until bedtime (after 2300 hrs), shifting its peak action period to 0500–0700 hrs. It is also a sensible precaution for patients to measure their blood glucose before they retire to bed and to have a carbohydrate snack if the reading is less than 6.0 mmol/L (approximately 110 mg/dL).</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0485"><ce:section-title id="st0465">Management of diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2125">The aims are to improve symptoms of hyperglycaemia and minimise the risks of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications.

However, alcohol can reduce hypoglycaemia awareness and, by suppressing gluconeogenesis, increase hypoglycaemia risk.

Insulin is the only treatment for type 1 diabetes, although sometimes metformin is used with insulin in type 1 diabetes. Acarbose is also available but is little used in most countries. Since the late 1990s, however, several new classes of agent have been approved for use in type 2 diabetes, with more in development. These include thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium and glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

This makes for an exciting time in diabetes pharmacotherapy but exactly how, when and in what order these agents should be used remains uncertain. The older drugs are cheaper and have established benefits for reducing microvascular disease; they are therefore usually recommended as first-line therapy. Use of the newer drugs is not supported by evidence for reduction in microvascular disease (because the trials have not yet been done) and they are much more expensive, so are often reserved for later therapy after failure of metformin and sulphonylureas. The American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) consensus guidelines are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0480" refid="f0085">Figure 20.10</ce:cross-ref>. These position metformin in the first line, and then aim to encourage choice of second-line treatment to be personalised for each patient. This personalisation is largely based on the adverse risk profile of the drug – in particular, risk of hypoglycaemia (avoid where hypoglycaemia would be a problem, e.g. in drivers of heavy goods vehicles) and weight gain. There is little evidence to guide the clinician and patient in choosing the second- or third-line treatment, and until biomarkers are identified that predict who will respond best and/or experience the fewest side-effects with one drug rather than another, this individualisation of treatment needs to be largely empirical. A trial-and-error approach may be best: stop a drug that does not work or that causes side-effects and trial the next drug. At the time of writing, the ADA/EASD guidelines were already out of date; in 2015/16, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide were shown to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. It is likely that the guidelines will change to take these exciting results into account and we will probably see these newer, more expensive drugs used earlier in the diabetes trajectory.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0615"><ce:section-title id="st0585">Biguanides</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2575">Metformin is the only biguanide available.

Metformin is usually introduced at low dose (500 mg twice daily) to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side-effects. The usual maintenance dose is 1 g twice daily. There is a modified-release formulation of metformin, which may be better tolerated by patients with gastrointestinal side-effects.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2590">Metformin can increase susceptibility to lactic acidosis, although this is much less common than was previously thought.

TZDs enhance the actions of endogenous insulin, both directly (in the adipose cells) and indirectly (by altering release of ‘adipokines’, such as adiponectin, which alter insulin sensitivity in the liver). Plasma insulin concentrations are not increased and hypoglycaemia does not occur.

The other TZD in common use, pioglitazone, does not appear to increase the risk of myocardial infarction but may exacerbate cardiac failure by causing fluid retention, and recent data show that it increases the risk of bone fracture and possibly bladder cancer. These observations have led to a dramatic reduction in the use of pioglitazone.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2630">Pioglitazone can be very effective at lowering blood glucose in some patients and appears more effective in insulin-resistant patients.

Pioglitazone is usually added to metformin with or without sulphonylurea therapy (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0500" refid="f0085">Fig. 20.10</ce:cross-ref>). It may be given with insulin therapy, when it can be very effective, but the combination of insulin and TZDs markedly increases fluid retention and risk of cardiac failure, so should be used with caution.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0665"><ce:section-title id="st0635">Incretin-based therapies: DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2635">The incretin effect is the augmentation of insulin secretion seen when a glucose stimulus is given orally rather than intravenously, and reflects the release of incretin peptides from the gut (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0505" refid="f0045">Fig. 20.3</ce:cross-ref>). The incretin hormones are primarily glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which act to potentiate insulin secretion (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0510" refid="f0040">Fig. 20.2</ce:cross-ref>). These are rapidly broken down by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). The incretin effect is diminished in type 2 diabetes, and this has stimulated the development of two incretin-based therapeutic approaches.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2640">The ‘gliptins’, or DPP-4 inhibitors, prevent breakdown and therefore enhance concentrations of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP. The first DPP-4 inhibitor to market was sitagliptin; others now available include vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and alogliptin. These drugs are very well tolerated and are weight-neutral (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0515" refid="b0155">Box 20.26</ce:cross-ref>). Recent cardiovascular outcome studies have shown mixed results with the DPP-4 inhibitors. The Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular Outcomes after Treatment with Sitagliptin (TECOS) study reported no adverse cardiovascular outcomes for sitagliptin, but the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) study found an increased risk of heart failure in patients treated with saxagliptin.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2645">The GLP-1 receptor agonists have a similar structure to GLP-1 but have been modified to resist breakdown by DPP-4. These agents are not orally active and have to be given by subcutaneous injection. However, they have a key advantage over the DPP-4 inhibitors: because the GLP-1 activity achieved is supra-physiological, it delays gastric emptying and, at the level of the hypothalamus, decreases appetite. Thus, injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists lower blood glucose and result in weight loss – an appealing therapy, as the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are obese. Currently available GLP-1 receptor agonists include exenatide (twice daily), exenatide modified-release (once weekly), liraglutide (once daily), lixisenatide (once daily) and albiglutide (once weekly). Recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists and long-acting insulin analogue have been combined, enabling co-administration of insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists with one injection. The GLP-1 receptor agonists vary in their side-effect profile, depending on whether they are administered daily or weekly, but the main side-effect that often limits use is nausea. The Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) study has recently demonstrated that liraglutide, when added to usual therapy, results in improved cardiovascular outcomes over placebo in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease; this contrasts with the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) study, which showed that lixisenatide was neutral with respect to cardiovascular disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2650">All the incretin-acting drugs have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, although this risk is small: between 1 and 10 cases per 1000 patients treated.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2655">Unlike sulphonylureas, both incretin-based therapies promote insulin secretion only when there is a glucose ‘trigger’ for it. Thus, when the blood glucose is normal, the insulin secretion is not augmented and so these agents do not cause hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy or with other drugs that do not cause hypoglycaemia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0670"><ce:section-title id="st0640">SGLT2 inhibitors</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2660">The sodium and glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, was licensed for use in 2012. Subsequently, canagliflozin and empagliflozin have also been licensed. Glucose is filtered freely in the renal glomeruli and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. SGLT2 is involved in reabsorption of glucose (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0520" refid="f0095">Fig. 20.12</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0095"/>). Inhibition results in approximately 25% of the filtered glucose not being reabsorbed, with consequent glycosuria. Although this helps to lower blood glucose and results in calorie loss and subsequent weight loss, the glycosuria does also lead to genital fungal infections. There has been increasing use of these agents over the last few years; however, the recent announcement of the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG Outcomes) trial has the potential to change dramatically the way these drugs are now used. Empagliflozin therapy resulted in a 35% reduction in cardiovascular mortality and a similar reduction in admissions to hospital with heart failure. This result was much greater than anticipated and the mechanism behind it is still being investigated, but this landmark study was the first to show such striking benefits in mortality reduction from a glucose-lowering agent; as such, these drugs should now, at the very least, be used in all patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria of the trial – prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke, unstable angina or occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (i.e. DKA not associated with marked hyperglycaemia) has been recognised as a rare complication of this class of drugs.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0675"><ce:section-title id="st0645">Insulin therapy</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0680"><ce:section id="s0685"><ce:section-title id="st0650">Manufacture and formulation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2665">Insulin was discovered in 1921 and transformed the management of type 1 diabetes, which was a fatal disorder until then. Up to the 1980s, insulin was obtained by extraction and purification from pancreases of cows and pigs (bovine and porcine insulins), and some patients still prefer to use animal insulins. Recombinant DNA technology enabled large-scale production of human insulin. Unmodified (‘soluble’ or ‘regular’) insulin aggregates into hexamers in subcutaneous tissues; these must dissociate before systemic absorption can occur and this process helps extend the duration of action to nearly 8 hours. The amino acid sequence of insulin can be altered to produce analogues of insulin, which differ in their rate of absorption from the site of injection. For example, in insulin lispro, the penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the β chain are reversed (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0525" refid="f0100">Fig. 20.13</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0100"/>). This prevents the insulin molecules from aggregating as hexamers in subcutaneous tissues after injection and so speeds absorption, leading to a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action than soluble insulin (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0530" refid="b0160">Box 20.27</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0160"/>). The onset of action of insulin analogues may be further hastened by the addition of excipients to the formulation (e.g. nicotinamide and arginine to insulin aspart). Conversely, in insulin glargine, a substitution of glycine for asparagine in the α chain and the addition of two additional arginine residues to the C-terminal end of the β chain serves to prolong the duration of action of the insulin to over 24 hours. The amino acid modifications shift the isoelectric point from a pH of 5.4 to 6.7, making the molecule less soluble at a physiological pH (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0535" refid="f0100">Fig. 20.13</ce:cross-ref>). Duration of action can also be extended by adding chemicals to soluble insulin solution or by adding other molecules to the insulin structure. Chemical additives include protamine and zinc at neutral pH (isophane or NPH insulin) or excess zinc ions (lente insulins). In insulin detemir and degludec, the duration of action is extended by adding fatty acids to a slightly truncated C-terminal end of the β chain (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0540" refid="f0100">Fig. 20.13</ce:cross-ref>). Following subcutaneous injection, these bind to albumin in the blood, from which the insulin slowly disassociates. The duration of action of insulin degludec may also be extended as the fatty acid moiety promotes the formation of multi-hexamers of insulin in the subcutaneous tissues (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0545" refid="b0160">Box 20.27</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2680">Isophane and lente insulins are cloudy preparations and have to be resuspended prior to injection to ensure adequate mixing of the components. The more modern, structurally modified, long-acting insulins (e.g. glargine, detemir and degludec) are clear and do not require resuspension. Pre-mixed formulations containing short-acting and isophane insulins in various proportions are available.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2685">In most countries, the insulin concentration in available formulations has been standardised at 100 U/mL. Increasing levels of obesity, which are associated with increased daily insulin requirements, have stimulated pharmaceutical companies to develop more concentrated insulin formulations to reduce the discomfort of injecting bigger volumes and also to reduce variability in insulin delivery from the subcutaneous depot. Therefore, U 200, U 300 and U 500 formulations of insulin are available, which are, respectively, two, three and five times more concentrated than standard insulin. Expert advice should be sought before using concentrated insulin because errors in prescribing can cause severe hypoglycaemia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0690"><ce:section-title id="st0655">Subcutaneous multiple dose insulin therapy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2690">In most patients, insulin is injected subcutaneously several times a day into the anterior abdominal wall, upper arms, outer thighs and buttocks (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0550" refid="b0165">Box 20.28</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0165"/>). Accidental intramuscular injection often occurs in children and thin adults. The rate of absorption of insulin may be influenced by many factors other than the insulin formulation, including the site, depth and volume of injection, skin temperature (warming), local massage and exercise. Absorption is delayed from areas of lipohypertrophy at injection sites (p. 721), which results from the local trophic action of insulin, so repeated injection at the same site should be avoided. Other routes of administration (intravenous and intraperitoneal) are reserved for specific circumstances.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2715">Once absorbed into the blood, insulin has a half-life of just a few minutes.

Unlike soluble insulin, which should be injected 30–60 minutes before eating, rapid-acting insulin analogues can be administered immediately before, during or even after meals, although are better injected 15 minutes before eating. Long-acting insulin analogues are also better able than isophane insulin to maintain ‘basal’ insulin levels for up to 24 hours.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2730">Despite these pharmacokinetic benefits, the impact of insulin analogues on overall glycaemic control is minor, but studies consistently show a significant reduction in frequency of hypoglycaemia, particularly overnight.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2735">The complications of insulin therapy are listed in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0560" refid="b0170">Box 20.29</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0170"/>; the most important of these is hypoglycaemia (p. 738). A common problem is fasting hyperglycaemia (‘the dawn phenomenon’), which arises through a combination of the normal circadian rhythm and release of hormones such as growth hormone and cortisol during the later part of the night, as well as diminishing levels of overnight isophane insulin. The dawn phenomenon is not a consequence of prior nocturnal hypoglycaemia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0695"><ce:section-title id="st0660">Insulin dosing regimens</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2775">The choice of regimen depends on the desired degree of glycaemic control, the severity of underlying insulin deficiency, the patient's lifestyle, and his or her ability to adjust the insulin dose.

People with type 1 diabetes are best managed by multiple daily insulin injections or an insulin pump. In type 2 diabetes, insulin is usually initiated as a once-daily long-acting insulin, either alone or in combination with oral antidiabetic agents. However, in time, more frequent insulin injections are usually required.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2780">Twice-daily administration of a short-acting and intermediate-acting insulin (usually soluble and isophane insulins), given in combination before breakfast and the evening meal, is the simplest regimen and is still commonly used in many countries. Initially, two-thirds of the total daily requirement of insulin is given in the morning in a ratio of short-acting to intermediate-acting of 1 : 2, and the remaining third is given in the evening. Pre-mixed formulations are available that contain different proportions of soluble and isophane insulins (e.g. 30 : 70 and 50 : 50). These are useful as they avoid the need for directly mixing insulins, but are inflexible as the individual components cannot be adjusted independently. They need to be resuspended by shaking the vial several times before administration. Fixed-mixture insulins also have altered pharmacodynamic profiles, such that the peak insulin action and time to peak effect are significantly reduced compared with separately injecting the same insulins. This increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2785">Multiple injection regimens (intensive insulin therapy) are popular, with short-acting insulin being taken before each meal, and intermediate- or long-acting insulin being injected once or twice daily (basal-bolus regimen, <ce:cross-ref id="crf0570" refid="b0175">Box 20.30</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0175"/>).

Device configurations vary between manufacturers but will include the pump with controls, processing module and batteries, a disposable insulin reservoir, and a disposable insulin set including cannula for subcutaneous insertion and a tubing system to deliver insulin from the reservoir to the cannula. Some recent versions are disposable or semi-disposable and eliminate tubing from the infusion set (patch pumps).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2805">Insulin pumps allow the individual more flexibility with bolus insulin injections in both timing and shape (e.g. using an extended bolus when covering high-fat/protein meals such as steak, or when diabetes is complicated by gastroparesis), and also in changing basal insulin infusion rates. This is especially useful overnight when basal rates can be reduced to prevent low glucose, but increased pre-dawn to prevent high glucose. In addition, the temporary basal rates can be used to lessen the risk of hypoglycaemia with exercise. Determining an individual's basal rate on the pump requires help from a specialist, but in essence is determined by fasting for periods of at least 4 hours while periodically evaluating the blood glucose levels and adjusting the pump infusion rate to maintain glucose in the normal range. Basal rates will change and can be influenced by factors such as increasing duration of disease, puberty, weight gain or loss, drugs that affect insulin sensitivity (e.g. glucocorticoids), and a change in fitness levels with exercise on overall glycaemic control. An example of an insulin pump is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0575" refid="f0110">Figure 20.15</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0110"/>.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0705"><ce:section-title id="st0670">Closed loop insulin therapy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2810">A further iteration in insulin pump therapy in recent years is the development of a ‘closed loop’ system, also known as the artificial pancreas (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0580" refid="f0115">Fig. 20.16</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0115"/>). These systems aim to integrate insulin pumps with continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS). In a closed loop system, the CGMS device communicates with the insulin pump via a computerised program. This means that real-time glucose data obtained through the CGMS can be used to calculate an insulin dosage to be dispensed through the insulin pump (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0585" refid="f0120">Fig. 20.17</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0120"/>). Features might include a ‘low-glucose suspend’ function, where detection of hypoglycaemia or a glucose level falling below a pre-set threshold (e.g. 4.0 mmol/L (72 mg/dL)) signals the pump to stop dispensing insulin until the wearer can treat the hypoglycaemia with food or glucose tabs. Current clinical trials in children and adults in the hospital or free-living setting aim to determine how effective this approach will be in optimising management of type 1 diabetes.

In most people this occurs in the context of a known diagnosis of diabetes; in some individuals, however, it is a consequence of stress hyperglycaemia (p. 728), while in others it is due to undiagnosed diabetes. Hyperglycaemia on admission to hospital is associated with increased length of stay and increased mortality in a wide variety of acute medical emergencies, including acute coronary syndrome and acute stroke. Intuitively, intensive glycaemic control with intravenous insulin should improve outcomes during acute illness. However, recent studies have shown that strategies aiming for near-normal blood glucose levels in acutely ill patients are associated with either increased mortality or no overall benefit. The reasons for the adverse outcomes are not established, but intensive glycaemic control is inevitably associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia because of the inherent limitations of modern insulins, the restricted frequency of glucose monitoring in a ward environment and the relative imprecision of near-patient blood glucose meters. The activation of the sympathetic nervous system and release of counter-regulatory hormones during acute hypoglycaemia could have deleterious consequences for the acutely ill patient.</ce:para><ce:para id="p9040">There is no consensus on the optimum glucose targets in acutely ill patients but extremes of blood glucose should be avoided, and so a target of between 6 and 12 mmol/L (105 and 180 mg/dL) seems appropriate.

Surgery causes catabolic stress and secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (including catecholamines and cortisol) in both normal and diabetic individuals. This results in increased glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis and insulin resistance. Starvation exacerbates this process by increasing lipolysis. In the non-diabetic person, these metabolic effects lead to a secondary increase in the secretion of insulin, which exerts a controlling influence. In diabetic patients, either there is absolute deficiency of insulin (type 1 diabetes) or insulin secretion is delayed and impaired (type 2 diabetes), so that in untreated or poorly controlled diabetes, the uptake of metabolic substrate into tissues is significantly reduced, catabolism is increased and, ultimately, metabolic decompensation in the form of DKA may develop in both types of diabetes. In addition, hyperglycaemia impairs wound healing and innate immunity, leading to increased risk of infection. Patients with diabetes are also more likely to have underlying pre-operative morbidity, especially cardiovascular disease. Finally, management errors in diabetes may cause dangerous hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. Careful pre-operative assessment and perioperative management are therefore essential, ideally with support from the diabetes specialist team.</ce:para><ce:section id="s9020"><ce:section-title id="st9010">Pre-operative assessment</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p9050">Unless a surgical intervention is an emergency, patients with diabetes should be assessed well in advance of surgery so that poor glycaemic control and other risk factors can be addressed (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9005" refid="b0190">Box 20.34</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0190"/>).

Macrovascular disease also causes substantial morbidity from myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, cardiac failure and intermittent claudication. The pathological changes of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are similar to those in the non-diabetic population but occur earlier in life and are more extensive and severe. Diabetes amplifies the effects of the other major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0635" refid="f0140">Fig. 20.20</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0140"/>). Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors, which co-segregate with insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome (p. 730). Mortality statistics from the USA indicate that cardiovascular death rates are 1.7 times higher in adults with diabetes aged 20 years or older compared to adults in the same age group who do not have diabetes, while similar figures for myocardial infarction show a 1.8 times greater rate. Hospitalisation rates for stroke were 1.5 times higher in adults with diabetes than in those without diabetes. In addition, 60% of non-traumatic amputations among people aged 20 years or older were reported to be in people with diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is also associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

There was a 60% overall reduction in the risk of developing diabetic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes on intensive therapy with strict glycaemic control, compared with those on conventional therapy. No single factor other than glycaemic control had a significant effect on outcome. However, the group that was intensively treated to lower blood glucose had three times the rate of severe hypoglycaemia. The UKPDS randomised patients to intensive treatment (mean HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> 53 mmol/mol) versus conventional treatment (mean HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> 64 mmol/mol). This study showed that, in type 2 diabetes, the frequency of diabetic complications is lower and progression is slower with good glycaemic control and effective treatment of hypertension, irrespective of the type of therapy used. Extrapolation from the UKPDS suggests that, for every 11 mmol/mol reduction in HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf>, there is a 21% reduction in death related to diabetes, a 14% reduction in myocardial infarction and 30–40% reduction in risk of microvascular complications (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0640" refid="f0140">Fig. 20.20</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p3145">These landmark trials demonstrated that diabetic complications are preventable and that the aim of treatment should be ‘near-normal’ glycaemia.

The risk of nephropathy is much greater in some ethnic groups, with epigenetic and genetic factors thought to influence this increased risk. Some patients do not develop nephropathy, however, despite having long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes, suggesting that they do not have a genetic predisposition. While variants in a few genes have been implicated in diabetic nephropathy, the major differences in individual risk remain unexplained. With improved standards of care focusing on glycaemic control and blood pressure lowering, the proportion of patients with overt nephropathy is reducing; however, due to the global rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, the prevalent number of people with diabetes and end-stage renal failure continues to rise.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3235">The pathophysiology is not fully understood and there are several postulated mechanisms by which hyperglycaemia causes the pathological changes seen in diabetic nephropathy.

The addition of a diuretic and/or salt restriction increase both the anti-proteinuric and antihypertensive effect of angiotensin blockade and therefore constitute an ideal second-line treatment. The benefit from blockade of the renin–angiotensin system arises from a reduction in the angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles in glomeruli (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0395" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00015-9#f0025">Fig. 15.1D</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0400" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00015-9#f0025">p. 385</ce:intra-ref>).

Therefore, electrolytes and renal function should be checked after initiation or each dose increase. If blockade of the renin–angiotensin system is not possible, blood pressure should managed with standard treatment, such as calcium channel blockers and diuretics.

The most common clinical signs are diminished perception of vibration sensation distally, ‘glove and stocking’ impairment of all other modalities of sensation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0675" refid="f0155">Fig. 20.23</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0155"/>), and loss of tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. In symptomatic patients, sensory abnormalities are predominant. Symptoms include paraesthesiae in the feet (and, rarely, in the hands), pain in the lower limbs (dull, aching and/or lancinating, worse at night, and felt mainly on the anterior aspect of the legs), burning sensations in the soles of the feet, cutaneous hyperaesthesia and, when severe, an abnormal gait (commonly wide-based), often associated with a sense of numbness in the feet. Weakness and atrophy, in particular of the interosseous muscles, develops, leading to structural changes in the foot with loss of lateral and transverse arches, clawing of the toes and exposure of the metatarsal heads. This results in increased pressure on the plantar aspects of the metatarsal heads, with the development of callus skin at these and other pressure points. Electrophysiological tests (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0430" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0150">p. 1074</ce:intra-ref>) demonstrate slowing of both motor and sensory conduction, and tests of vibration sensitivity and thermal thresholds are abnormal.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3400">A diffuse small-fibre neuropathy causes altered perception of pain and temperature, and is associated with symptomatic autonomic neuropathy; characteristic features include foot ulcers and Charcot neuroarthropathy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0850"><ce:section-title id="st0795">Asymmetrical motor diabetic neuropathy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3405">Sometimes called diabetic amyotrophy, this presents as severe and progressive weakness and wasting of the proximal muscles of the lower (and occasionally the upper) limbs. It is commonly accompanied by severe pain, felt mainly on the anterior aspect of the leg, and hyperaesthesia and paraesthesiae. Sometimes there may also be marked loss of weight (‘neuropathic cachexia’). The patient may look extremely ill and be unable to get out of bed. Tendon reflexes may be absent on the affected side(s). Sometimes there are extensor plantar responses and the cerebrospinal fluid protein is often raised. This condition is thought to involve acute infarction of the lower motor neurons of the lumbosacral plexus. Other lesions involving this plexus, such as neoplasms and lumbar disc disease, must be excluded. Although recovery usually occurs within 12 months, some deficits are permanent. Management is mainly supportive.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0855"><ce:section-title id="st0800">Mononeuropathy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3410">Either motor or sensory function can be affected within a single peripheral or cranial nerve. Unlike the gradual progression of distal symmetrical and autonomic neuropathies, mononeuropathies are severe and of rapid onset, but they eventually recover. The nerves most commonly affected are the 3rd and 6th cranial nerves (resulting in diplopia), and the femoral and sciatic nerves. Rarely, involvement of other single nerves results in paresis and paraesthesiae in the thorax and trunk (truncal radiculopathies).</ce:para><ce:para id="p3415">Nerve compression palsies are more common in diabetes, frequently affecting the median nerve and giving the clinical picture of carpal tunnel syndrome, and less commonly the ulnar nerve. Lateral popliteal nerve compression occasionally causes foot drop. Compression palsies may be more common because of glycosylation and thickening of connective tissue and/or because of increased susceptibility of nerves affected by diabetic microangiopathy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0860"><ce:section-title id="st0805">Autonomic neuropathy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3420">This is not necessarily associated with peripheral somatic neuropathy. Parasympathetic or sympathetic nerves may be predominantly affected in one or more visceral systems. The resulting symptoms and signs are listed in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0680" refid="b0225">Box 20.41</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0225"/> and tests of autonomic function in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0685" refid="b0230">Box 20.42</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0230"/>. The development of autonomic neuropathy is related to poor metabolic control less clearly than to somatic neuropathy, and improved control rarely results in improved symptoms. Within 10 years of developing overt symptoms of autonomic neuropathy, 30–50% of patients are dead, many from sudden cardiorespiratory arrest. Patients with postural hypotension (a drop in systolic pressure of 30 mmHg or more on standing from the supine position) have the highest subsequent mortality.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0865"><ce:section-title id="st0810">Gastroparesis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3545">Gastroparesis is diagnosed when there is an objectively measured delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It is most commonly a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy in diabetes, but can occur with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia that are also associated with diabetes. Prevalence rates are estimated to be approximately 5% in type 1 diabetes and 1% in type 2 diabetes. The main symptoms are chronic nausea, vomiting (especially of undigested food), abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness/early satiety. Diagnosis is most commonly made by <ce:sup loc="post">99m</ce:sup>-technetium scintigraphy following a solid-phase meal with standard imaging over 4 hours. In this test it is important to recognise that high glucose levels can delay gastric emptying and so every attempt should be made to conduct the test when glucose levels are below 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL). Other tests include upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, wireless motility capsules and breath testing (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0435" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s0155">pp. 774</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0440" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s0210">776</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii0445" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s0310">777</ce:intra-ref>). Management is difficult, with glucose levels directly impacting on gastric motility and, conversely, gastroparesis affecting absorption of ingested carbohydrate. Insulin pump therapy may be especially useful in this context; patients on conventional injection therapy may benefit from injecting rapid-acting insulin after a meal rather than before. Recommended dietary changes include following low-fibre and low-residue diets, as well as eating smaller amounts more frequently. Enteral nutrition is rarely required unless gastroparesis is very severe. Recommended pharmacological and interventional therapy is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0700" refid="b0235">Box 20.43</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0235"/>.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0910"><ce:section-title id="st0855">Erectile dysfunction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3750">Erectile failure (impotence) affects 30% of diabetic males and is often multifactorial. Although neuropathy and vascular causes are common, psychological factors, including depression, anxiety and reduced libido, may be partly responsible. Alcohol and antihypertensive drugs, such as thiazide diuretics and β-adrenoceptor antagonists (β-blockers), may cause sexual dysfunction and in some patients there may be an endocrine cause, such as testosterone deficiency or hyperprolactinaemia.

Tissue necrosis in the feet is a common reason for hospital admission in diabetic patients. Treatment of the foot complications of diabetes accounts for more inpatient days than any other diabetes-related complication.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0925"><ce:section id="s0930"><ce:section-title id="st0870">Aetiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3765">Foot ulceration occurs as a result of trauma (often trivial) in the presence of neuropathy and/or peripheral vascular disease (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0480" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00016-0#p4280">p. 502</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0710" refid="f0155">Fig. 20.23</ce:cross-ref>); with infection is a secondary phenomenon following disruption of the protective epidermis. Most ulcers develop at the site of a plaque of callus skin, beneath which tissue necrosis occurs and eventually breaks through to the surface. In many cases, multiple components are involved but sometimes neuropathy or ischaemia predominates (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0715" refid="b0240">Box 20.44</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0240"/>). Ischaemia alone accounts for a minority of foot ulcers in diabetic patients, with most being either neuropathic or neuro-ischaemic.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3775">Charcot neuroarthropathy is a progressive condition affecting the bones and joints of the foot; it is characterised by early inflammation and then joint dislocation, subluxation and pathological fractures of the foot of neuropathic patients, often resulting in debilitating deformity (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0720" refid="f0155">Fig. 20.23</ce:cross-ref> and p. 720). Charcot neuroarthropathy can arise in any condition that causes neuropathy (including syphilis, spinal cord injury, syringomyelia etc.) but diabetes is the most common cause. The pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood but may involve unperceived trauma, leading to progressive destruction (the ‘neurotraumatic’ theory) and/or increased blood flow that results in a mismatch of bone destruction and synthesis (the ‘neurovascular’ theory). More recent evidence points to disordered inflammation mediated via the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)/receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) pathway, opening the way for trials of the RANKL inhibitor denosumab (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0490" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#s1690">p. 1048</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0935"><ce:section-title id="st0875">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3780">Management can be divided into primary prevention and treatment of an active problem. All patients should be educated in preventative measures (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0725" refid="b0245">Box 20.45</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0245"/>). The feet of people with diabetes should be screened annually, following the steps listed on <ce:cross-ref id="crf9025" refid="u0135">page 721</ce:cross-ref>. Two simple tests are required to grade risk: a 10 g monofilament should be used to assess sensation at five points on each foot, and foot pulses should be palpated (dorsalis pedis and/or posterior tibial). Combined with the clinical scenario, these tests guide appropriate referral and monitoring (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0730" refid="f0160">Fig. 20.24</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0160"/>). Removal of callus skin with a scalpel is best done by a podiatrist who has specialist training and experience in diabetic foot problems.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0965"><ce:section-title id="st0905">Foot ulcer</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3880">Once a foot ulcer develops, patients should ideally be referred to a multidisciplinary foot team, involving a diabetes specialist, a podiatrist, a vascular surgeon and an orthotist. Treatment involves: débridement of dead tissue; prompt, often prolonged, treatment with antibiotics if required, as infection can accelerate tissue necrosis and lead to gangrene; and pressure relief using customised insoles, specialised orthotic footwear and sometimes total contact plaster cast or an irremovable aircast boot. If an ulcer is neuro-ischaemic, a vascular assessment is often carried out, by ultrasound or angiography, as revascularisation by angioplasty or surgery may be required to allow the ulcer to heal. In cases of severe secondary infection or gangrene, an amputation may be required. This can be limited to the affected toe or involve more extensive limb amputation.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0970"><ce:section-title id="st0910">Charcot neuroarthropathy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3885">Acute Charcot neuroarthropathy almost always presents with signs of inflammation – a hot, red, swollen foot. The initial X-ray may show bony destruction but is often normal. As about 40% of patients with a Charcot joint also have a foot ulcer, it can be difficult to differentiate from osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the foot is often helpful. The mainstay of treatment for an active Charcot foot is immobilisation and, ideally, avoidance of weight-bearing on the affected foot. The rationale is that if no pressure is applied through the foot, the destructive process involving the bones will not result in significant deformity when the acute inflammatory process subsides. Immobilisation is often achieved by a total contact plaster cast or ‘aircast’ boot. The acute phase frequently lasts 3–6 months and sometimes longer. In the post-acute phase, there is consolidation and remodelling of fracture fragments, eventually resulting in a stable foot.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0915">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0010"><ce:section-title id="st0920">Books and journal articles</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib2"><ce:label>1993</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0015"><sb:comment>Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group</sb:comment><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:title><sb:maintitle>The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>N Engl J Med</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>329</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>1993</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>977</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>986</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib3"><ce:label>Nathan et al, 2005</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0020"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>DM</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Nathan</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>PA</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Cleary</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>JY</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Backlud</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:et-al/></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group.
