by other cell types in the liver, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (tissue macrophages), platelets and lymphocytes. Once stellate cells become activated, they can perpetuate their own activation by synthesis of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf>), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) through autocrine loops. Activated stellate cells produce TGF-β<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf>, stimulating the production of collagen matrix, as well as inhibitors of collagen breakdown. The inhibitors of collagen breakdown, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9), are inactivated in turn by tissue inhibitors TIMP1 and TIMP2, which are increased in fibrosis. Inflammation also contributes to fibrosis, with the cytokine profile produced by Th2 lymphocytes, such as interleukin-6 and 13 (IL-6 and IL-13). Activated stellate cells also produce endothelin 1 (ET1), which may contribute to portal hypertension.

At the canalicular membrane, these bile acids are secreted via the bile salt export pump (BSEP) into bile. Multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3), also situated on the canalicular membrane, transports phospholipid to the outer side of the membrane. This solubilises bile acids, forming micelles and protecting bile duct membranes from bile salt damage. Familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) moves phosphatidylserine from the inside to the outside of the canalicular membrane; mutations result in familial cholestasis syndrome in childhood. MDR2 (multidrug resistance 2) regulates transport of glutathione. Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) transports bilirubin and is induced by rifampicin. Organic anion transporter protein (OATP) transports bilirubin and organic anions.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0040" role="short">Fig. 22.7</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0070" locator="f022-007-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-007-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0070"><ce:label>Fig. 22.8</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0060"><ce:simple-para id="sp0115" role="title">Ultrasound showing a stone in the gallbladder (A) with acoustic shadow (S).</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0045" role="short">Fig. 22.8</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0110" locator="f022-008-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-008-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0075"><ce:label>Fig. 22.9</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0065"><ce:simple-para id="sp0120" role="title">Computed tomography in a patient with cirrhosis.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0125" role="caption">The liver is small and has an irregular outline (black arrow), the spleen is enlarged (long white arrow), fluid (ascites) is seen around the liver, and collateral vessels are present around the proximal stomach (short white arrow).</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0050" role="short">Fig. 22.9</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0115" locator="f022-009-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-009-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0080"><ce:label>Fig. 22.10</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0070"><ce:simple-para id="sp0130" role="title">Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing a biliary stricture due to cholangiocarcinoma in the distal common bile duct (arrow).</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0135" role="caption">The proximal common bile duct (CBD) is dilated but the pancreatic duct (PD) is normal.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0055" role="short">Fig. 22.10</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0120" locator="f022-010-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-010-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0085"><ce:label>Fig. 22.11</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0075"><ce:simple-para id="sp0140" role="title">Causes of acute and chronic liver injury.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0145" role="caption">*Although there is often evidence of chronic liver disease at presentation, may present acutely with jaundice.

An immunological response to the virus then occurs, with elevation in serum transaminases, which causes liver damage: chronic hepatitis. If this response is sustained over many years and viral clearance does not occur promptly, chronic hepatitis may result in cirrhosis. In individuals with a successful immunological response, viral load falls, HBe antibody (HBeAg) develops and there is no further liver damage. Some individuals may subsequently develop HBV-DNA mutants that escape from immune regulation, and viral load again rises with further chronic hepatitis. Mutations in the core protein result in the virus's inability to secrete HBe antigen despite high levels of viral replication; such individuals have HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis.

The pre-C and C regions encode a core protein and an e antigen. Although mutations in the hepatitis B virus are frequent, certain mutations have important clinical consequences. Pre-C encodes a signal sequence needed for the C protein to be secreted from the liver cell into serum as e antigen. A mutation in the pre-core region leads to a failure of secretion of e antigen into serum, and so individuals have high levels of viral production but no detectable e antigen in the serum. Mutations can also occur in the surface protein and may lead to the failure of vaccination to prevent infection, since surface antibodies are produced against the native S protein. Mutations also occur in the DNA polymerase during antiviral treatment with lamivudine.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0140" role="short">Fig. 22.27</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0355" locator="f022-027-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-027-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0170"><ce:label>Fig. 22.28</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0160"><ce:simple-para id="sp0310" role="title">Direct-acting antiviral agents.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0315" role="caption">These compounds are targeted to specific steps in the hepatitis C viral life cycle to disrupt replication.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0145" role="short">Fig. 22.28</ce:alt-text><ce:source>(5′NTR = 5′ non-translated region; HCV = hepatitis C virus; IFN = interferon)</ce:source><ce:link id="ln0375" locator="f022-028-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-028-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0175"><ce:label>Fig. 22.29</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0165"><ce:simple-para id="sp0320" role="title">Factors involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0150" role="short">Fig. 22.29</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0395" locator="f022-029-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000226/f022-029-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0180"><ce:label>Fig. 22.30</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0170"><ce:simple-para id="sp0325" role="title">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0330" role="caption"><ce:bold>A</ce:bold> Features.

It is classically divided into left and right lobes by the falciform ligament, but a more useful functional division is into the right and left hemilivers, based on blood supply (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0335" refid="f0035">Fig. 22.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0035"/>). These are further divided into eight segments, according to subdivisions of the hepatic and portal veins. Each segment has its own branch of the hepatic artery and biliary tree. The segmental anatomy of the liver has an important influence on imaging and treatment of liver tumours, given the increasing use of surgical resection. A liver segment is made up of multiple smaller units known as lobules, comprised of a central vein, radiating sinusoids separated from each other by single liver cell (hepatocyte) plates, and peripheral portal tracts. The functional unit of the liver is the hepatic acinus (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0340" refid="f0040">Fig. 22.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0040"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0525">Blood flows into the acinus via a single branch of the portal vein and hepatic artery situated centrally in the portal tracts. Blood flows outwards along the hepatic sinusoids into one of several tributaries of the hepatic vein at the periphery of the acinus. Bile, formed by active and passive excretion by hepatocytes into channels called cholangioles, which lie between them, flows in the opposite direction from the periphery of the acinus. The cholangioles converge in interlobular bile ducts in the portal tracts. The hepatocytes in each acinus lie in three zones, depending on their position relative to the portal tract. Those in zone 1 are closest to the terminal branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and are richly supplied with oxygenated blood, and with blood containing the highest concentration of nutrients and toxins. Conversely, hepatocytes in zone 3 are furthest from the portal tracts and closest to the hepatic veins, and are therefore relatively hypoxic and exposed to lower concentrations of nutrients and toxins compared to zone 1. The different perfusion and toxin exposure patterns, and thus vulnerability, of hepatocytes in the different zones contribute to the often patchy nature of liver injury.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0090"><ce:section-title id="st0085">Liver cells</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0530">Hepatocytes comprise 80% of liver cells.

The endothelial cells have gaps between them (fenestrae) of about 0.1 micron in diameter, allowing free flow of fluid and particulate matter to the hepatocytes. Individual hepatocytes are separated from the leaky sinusoids by the space of Disse, which contains stellate cells that store vitamin A and play an important part in regulating liver blood flow. They may also be immunologically active and play a role in the liver's contribution to defence against pathogens. The key role of stellate cells in terms of pathology is in the development of hepatic fibrosis, the precursor of cirrhosis. They undergo activation in response to cytokines produced following liver injury, differentiating into myofibroblasts, which are the major producers of the collagen-rich matrix that forms fibrous tissue (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0350" refid="f0050">Fig. 22.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0050"/>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0095"><ce:section-title id="st0090">Blood supply</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0540">The liver is unique as an organ, as it has dual perfusion: it receives a majority of its supply via the portal vein, which drains blood from the gut via the splanchnic circulation and is the principal route for nutrient trafficking to the liver, and a minority from the hepatic artery. The portal venous contribution is 50–90%. The dual perfusion system, and the variable contribution from portal vein and hepatic artery, can have important effects on the clinical expression of liver ischaemia (which typically exhibits a less dramatic pattern than ischaemia in other organs, a fact that can sometimes lead to it being missed clinically), and can raise practical challenges in liver transplant surgery.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0100"><ce:section-title id="st0095">Biliary system and gallbladder</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0545">Hepatocytes provide the driving force for bile flow by creating osmotic gradients of bile acids, which form micelles in bile (bile acid-dependent bile flow), and of sodium (bile acid-independent bile flow). Bile is secreted by hepatocytes and flows from cholangioles to the biliary canaliculi. The canaliculi join to form larger intrahepatic bile ducts, which in turn merge to form the right and left hepatic ducts. These ducts join as they emerge from the liver to form the common hepatic duct, which becomes the common bile duct after joining the cystic duct (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0355" refid="f0040">Fig. 22.2</ce:cross-ref>). The common bile duct is approximately 5 cm long and 4–6 mm wide. The distal portion of the duct passes through the head of the pancreas and usually joins the pancreatic duct before entering the duodenum through the ampullary sphincter (sphincter of Oddi). It should be noted, though, that the anatomy of the lower common bile duct can vary widely. Common bile duct pressure is maintained by rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi; this pressure exceeds gallbladder pressure in the fasting state, so that bile normally flows into the gallbladder, where it is concentrated 10-fold by resorption of water and electrolytes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0550">The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac typically lying under the right hemiliver, with its fundus located anteriorly behind the tip of the 9th costal cartilage. Anatomical variation is common and should be considered when assessing patients clinically and radiologically. The function of the gallbladder is to concentrate, and provide a reservoir for, bile. Gallbladder tone is maintained by vagal activity, and cholecystokinin released from the duodenal mucosa during feeding causes gallbladder contraction and reduces sphincter pressure, so that bile flows into the duodenum. The body and neck of the gallbladder pass posteromedially towards the porta hepatis, and the cystic duct then joins it to the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct mucosa has prominent crescentic folds (valves of Heister), giving it a beaded appearance on cholangiography.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0105"><ce:section-title id="st0100">Hepatic function</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0110"><ce:section-title id="st0105">Carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0555">The liver plays a central role in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism, and is also involved in metabolising drugs and environmental toxins (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0360" refid="f0055">Fig. 22.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0055"/>). An important and increasingly recognised role for the liver is in the integration of metabolic pathways, regulating the response of the body to feeding and starvation. Abnormality in metabolic pathways and their regulation can play an important role both in liver disease (e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) and in diseases that are not conventionally regarded as diseases of the liver (such as type 2 diabetes and inborn errors of metabolism).

Reduced clotting factor synthesis is an important and easily accessible biomarker of liver function in the setting of liver injury. Prothrombin time (PT; or the International Normalised Ratio, INR) is therefore one of the most important clinical tools available for the assessment of hepatocyte function.

Between 425 and 510 mmol (250–300 mg) of unconjugated bilirubin is produced from the catabolism of haem daily. Bilirubin in the blood is normally almost all unconjugated and, because it is not water-soluble, is bound to albumin and does not pass into the urine. Unconjugated bilirubin is taken up by hepatocytes at the sinusoidal membrane, where it is conjugated in the endoplasmic reticulum by UDP-glucuronyl transferase, producing bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide. Impaired conjugation by this enzyme is a cause of inherited hyperbilirubinaemias (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0370" refid="b0035">Box 22.17</ce:cross-ref>). These bilirubin conjugates are water-soluble and are exported into the bile canaliculi by specific carriers on the hepatocyte membranes.

A small amount of stercobilinogen (4 mg/day) is absorbed from the bowel, passes through the liver and is excreted in the urine, where it is known as urobilinogen or, following further oxidisation, urobilin. The liver secretes 1–2 L of bile daily. Bile contains bile acids (formed from cholesterol), phospholipids, bilirubin and cholesterol. Several biliary transporter proteins have been identified (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0375" refid="f0065">Fig. 22.7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0065"/>).

This distinguishes it from instances in which hepatic encephalopathy represents a deterioration in chronic liver disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1000">Liver failure occurs when there is insufficient metabolic and synthetic function for the needs of the patient. Although the direct cause is usually acute loss of functional hepatocytes, this can occur in different settings, which have implications for outcome and treatment. In a patient whose liver was previously normal (fulminant liver failure), the level of injury needed to cause liver failure, and thus the patient risk, is very high. In a patient with pre-existing chronic liver disease, the additional acute insult needed to precipitate liver failure is much less. It is critical, therefore, to understand whether liver failure is a true acute event or an acute deterioration on a background of pre-existing injury (which may itself not have been diagnosed). Although liver biopsy may ultimately be necessary, it is the presence or absence of the clinical features suggesting chronicity that guides the clinician.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1005">More recently, newer classifications have been developed to reflect differences in presentation and outcome of acute liver failure.

Hepatitis B core IgM antibody is the best screening test for acute hepatitis B infection, as liver damage is due to the immunological response to the virus, which has often been eliminated, and the test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may be negative. The PT rapidly becomes prolonged as coagulation factor synthesis fails; this is the laboratory test of greatest prognostic value and should be carried out at least twice daily. Its prognostic importance emphasises the necessity of avoiding the use of fresh frozen plasma to correct raised PT in acute liver failure, except in the setting of frank bleeding. Factor V levels can be used instead of the PT to assess the degree of liver impairment. The plasma bilirubin reflects the degree of jaundice. Plasma aminotransferase activity is particularly high after paracetamol overdose, reaching 100–500 times normal, but falls as liver damage progresses and is not helpful in determining prognosis.

When abnormal results are found, it is important for the clinician to be able to interpret them and to investigate appropriately. Many patients with chronic liver disease are asymptomatic or have vague, non-specific symptoms. Apparently asymptomatic abnormal LFTs are therefore a common occurrence. When LFTs are measured routinely prior to elective surgery, 3.5% of patients are discovered to have mildly elevated transaminases. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs has been reported to be as high as 10% in some studies.

Many primary disorders of the peritoneum and visceral organs can also cause ascites, and these need to be considered even in a patient with chronic liver disease (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0625" refid="b0145">Box 22.21</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0145"/>). Splanchnic vasodilatation is thought to be the main factor leading to ascites in cirrhosis. This is mediated by vasodilators (mainly nitric oxide) that are released when portal hypertension causes shunting of blood into the systemic circulation. Systemic arterial pressure falls due to pronounced splanchnic vasodilatation as cirrhosis advances. This leads to activation of the renin–angiotensin system with secondary aldosteronism, increased sympathetic nervous activity, increased atrial natriuretic hormone secretion and altered activity of the kallikrein–kinin system (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0645" refid="f0110">Fig. 22.16</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0110"/>). These systems tend to normalise arterial pressure but produce salt and water retention. In this setting, the combination of splanchnic arterial vasodilatation and portal hypertension alters intestinal capillary permeability, promoting accumulation of fluid within the peritoneum.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0345"><ce:section-title id="st0330">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1860">Ultrasonography is the best means of detecting ascites, particularly in the obese and those with small volumes of fluid.

Pleural effusions are found in about 10% of patients, usually on the right side (hepatic hydrothorax); most are small and identified only on chest X-ray, but occasionally a massive hydrothorax occurs. Pleural effusions, particularly those on the left side, should not be assumed to be due to the ascites.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1925">Measurement of the protein concentration and the serum–ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) can be a useful tool to distinguish ascites of different aetiologies. Cirrhotic patients typically develop ascites with a low protein concentration (‘transudate’; protein concentration &#x003C; 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL)) and relatively few cells. In up to 30% of patients, however, the total protein concentration is &#x003E; 30 g/L (3.0 g/dL). In these cases, it is useful to calculate the SAAG by subtracting the concentration of the ascites fluid albumin from the serum albumin. A gradient of &#x003E; 11 g/L (1.1 g/dL) is 96% predictive that ascites is due to portal hypertension. Venous outflow obstruction due to cardiac failure or hepatic venous outflow obstruction can also cause a transudative ascites, as indicated by an albumin gradient of &#x003E; 11 g/L (1.1 g/dL) but, unlike in cirrhosis, the total protein content is usually &#x003E; 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL).</ce:para><ce:para id="p1930">High protein ascites (‘exudate’; protein concentration &#x003E; 25 g/L (2.5 g/dL) or a SAAG of &#x003C; 11 g/L (1.1 g/dL) raises the possibility of infection (especially tuberculosis), malignancy, pancreatic ascites or, rarely, hypothyroidism. Ascites amylase activity of &#x003E; 1000 U/L identifies pancreatic ascites, whereas low ascites glucose concentrations suggest malignant disease or tuberculosis.

Treatment of transudative ascites is based on restricting sodium and water intake, promoting urine output with diuretics and, if necessary, removing ascites directly by paracentesis. Exudative ascites due to malignancy is treated with paracentesis but fluid replacement is generally not required. During management of ascites, the patient should be weighed regularly.

As it progresses, delirium is followed by coma. Simple delirium needs to be differentiated from delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy, and coma from subdural haematoma, which can occur in alcoholics after a fall (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0665" refid="b0160">Box 22.24</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0160"/>). Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs.

Hepatic encephalopathy rarely causes focal neurological signs; if these are present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to the breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and portosystemic shunting than of hepatic encephalopathy.

Accordingly, most affected patients have evidence of liver failure and portosystemic shunting of blood, but the balance between these varies from individual to individual. Some degree of liver failure is a key factor, as portosystemic shunting of blood alone hardly ever causes encephalopathy. The ‘neurotoxins’ causing encephalopathy are unknown but are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in part by bacterial action. These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an important factor. Recent interest has focused on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters. The brain in cirrhosis may also be sensitised to other factors, such as drugs that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0680" refid="b0165">Box 22.25</ce:cross-ref>).

Dietary protein restriction is rarely needed and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment because it is unpalatable and can lead to a worsening nutritional state in already malnourished patients. Lactulose (15–30 mL 3 times daily) is increased gradually until the bowels are moving twice daily. It produces an osmotic laxative effect, reduces the pH of the colonic content, thereby limiting colonic ammonia absorption, and promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into bacteria. Rifaximin (400 mg 3 times daily) is a well-tolerated, non-absorbed antibiotic that acts by reducing the bacterial content of the bowel and has been shown to be effective. It can be used in addition, or as an alternative, to lactulose if diarrhoea becomes troublesome.

A reduction in liver size is especially common if the cause is viral hepatitis or autoimmune liver disease. The liver is often hard, irregular and non-tender. Jaundice is mild when it first appears and is due primarily to a failure to excrete bilirubin. Palmar erythema can be seen early in the disease but is of limited diagnostic value, as it occurs in many other conditions associated with a hyper-dynamic circulation, including normal pregnancy, as well as being found in some healthy people. Spider telangiectasias occur and comprise a central arteriole (that occasionally raises the skin surface), from which small vessels radiate.

Schistosomiasis is the most common cause of portal hypertension worldwide but is infrequent outside endemic areas, such as Egypt (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0235" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00011-1#s2670">p. 294</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s0490"><ce:section id="s0495"><ce:section id="s0500"><ce:section-title id="st0460">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2455">The clinical features result principally from portal venous congestion and collateral vessel formation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0745" refid="b0185">Box 22.31</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0185"/>). Splenomegaly is a cardinal finding and a diagnosis of portal hypertension is unusual when splenomegaly cannot be detected clinically or by ultrasonography. The spleen is rarely enlarged more than 5 cm below the left costal margin in adults but more marked splenomegaly can occur in childhood and adolescence. Collateral vessels may be visible on the anterior abdominal wall and occasionally several radiate from the umbilicus to form a ‘caput medusae’ (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9130" refid="s0010">p. 846</ce:cross-ref>). Rarely, a large umbilical collateral vessel has a blood flow sufficient to give a venous hum on auscultation (Cruveilhier–Baumgarten syndrome). The most important collateral vessel formation occurs in the oesophagus and stomach, and this can be a source of severe bleeding. Rectal varices also cause bleeding and are often mistaken for haemorrhoids (which are no more common in portal hypertension than in the general population). Fetor hepaticus results from portosystemic shunting of blood, which allows mercaptans to pass directly to the lungs.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2500">Ascites occurs as a result of renal sodium retention and portal hypertension that may be due, for example, to post-hepatic causes (hepatic outflow obstruction, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9135" refid="s0315">p. 862</ce:cross-ref>) or cirrhosis.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2505">The most important consequence of portal hypertension is variceal bleeding, which commonly arises from oesophageal varices located within 3–5 cm of the gastro-oesophageal junction, or from gastric varices. The size of the varices, endoscopic variceal features such as red spots and stripes, high portal pressure and liver failure are all general factors that predispose to bleeding. Drugs capable of causing mucosal erosion, such as salicylates and NSAIDs, can also precipitate bleeding. Variceal bleeding is often severe, and recurrent if preventative treatment is not given.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0505"><ce:section-title id="st0465">Pathophysiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2510">Increased portal vascular resistance leads to a gradual reduction in the flow of portal blood to the liver and simultaneously to the development of collateral vessels, allowing portal blood to bypass the liver and enter the systemic circulation directly. Portosystemic shunting occurs, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract and especially the distal oesophagus, stomach and rectum, in the anterior abdominal wall, and in the renal, lumbar, ovarian and testicular vasculature. Stomal varices can also occur at the site of an ileostomy. As collateral vessel formation progresses, more than half of the portal blood flow may be shunted directly to the systemic circulation. Increased portal flow contributes to portal hypertension but is not the dominant factor.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0510"><ce:section-title id="st0470">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2515">The diagnosis is often made clinically. Portal venous pressure measurements are rarely needed for clinical assessment or routine management but can be used to confirm portal hypertension and to differentiate sinusoidal and pre-sinusoidal forms. Pressure measurements are made by using a balloon catheter inserted using the transjugular route (via the inferior vena cava into a hepatic vein and then hepatic venule) to measure the WHVP. This is an indirect measurement of portal vein pressure. Thrombocytopenia is common due to hypersplenism, and platelet counts are usually in the region of 100 × 10<ce:sup loc="post">9</ce:sup>/L; values below 50 × 10<ce:sup loc="post">9</ce:sup>/L are uncommon. Leucopenia occurs occasionally but anaemia is seldom attributed directly to hypersplenism; if anaemia is found, a source of bleeding should be sought.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2520">Endoscopy is the most useful investigation to determine whether gastro-oesophageal varices are present (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0750" refid="f0115">Fig. 22.17</ce:cross-ref>). Once the diagnosis of cirrhosis is made, endoscopy should be performed to screen for oesophageal varices (and repeated every 2 years). Ultrasonography often shows features of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly and collateral vessels, and can sometimes indicate the cause, such as liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. CT and magnetic resonance angiography can identify the extent of portal vein clot and are used to identify hepatic vein patency.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0515"><ce:section-title id="st0475">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2525">Acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage from gastro-oesophageal varices is a common manifestation of chronic liver disease. In the presence of portal hypertension, the risk of a variceal bleed occurring within 2 years varies from 7% for small varices up to 30% for large varices. The mortality following a variceal bleed has improved to around 15% overall but is still about 45% in those with poor liver function (i.e. Child–Pugh C).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2530">The management of portal hypertension is largely focused on the prevention and/or control of variceal haemorrhage. It is important to remember, though, that bleeding can also result from peptic ulceration, which is more common in patients with liver disease than in the general population. The investigation and management of gastrointestinal bleeding are dealt with in more detail on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0250" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s0390">page 780</ce:intra-ref>.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0520"><ce:section-title id="st0480">Primary prevention of variceal bleeding</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2535">If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, β-adrenoceptor antagonist (β-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80–160 mg/day) or nadolol (40–240 mg/day) is effective in reducing portal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the heart rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNT<ce:inf loc="post">B</ce:inf>) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNT<ce:inf loc="post">B</ce:inf> 25) and overall mortality by 22% (NNT<ce:inf loc="post">B</ce:inf> 16). The efficacy of β-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to β-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating β-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25–12.5 mg/day).

The source of bleeding should always be confirmed by endoscopy because about 20% of patients are bleeding from non-variceal lesions. Management of acute variceal bleeding is described in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0755" refid="b0190">Box 22.32</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0190"/> and illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0765" refid="f0135">Figure 22.21</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0135"/>. All patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding should receive prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as oral ciprofloxacin or intravenous cephalosporin or piperacillin/tazobactam, because sepsis is common and treatment with antibiotics improves outcomes. The measures used to control acute variceal bleeding include vasoactive medications (e.g. terlipressin), endoscopic therapy (banding or sclerotherapy), balloon tamponade, TIPSS and, rarely, oesophageal transection.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0530"><ce:section-title id="st0490">Pharmacological reduction of portal venous pressure</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2550">Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that, in contrast to vasopressin, can be given by intermittent injection rather than continuous infusion. It reduces portal blood flow and/or intrahepatic resistance and hence brings down portal pressure. It lowers mortality in the setting of acute variceal bleeding. The dose of terlipressin is 2 mg IV 4 times daily until bleeding stops, and then 1 mg 4 times daily for up to 72 hours. Caution is needed in patients with severe ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease because of the drug's vasoconstrictor properties. In countries where terlipressin is not available, octreotide is a frequently used alternative.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0535"><ce:section-title id="st0495">Variceal ligation (‘banding’) and sclerotherapy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2555">This is the most widely used initial treatment and is undertaken, if possible, at the time of diagnostic endoscopy (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0770" refid="f0115">Fig. 22.17C</ce:cross-ref>). It stops variceal bleeding in 80% of patients and can be repeated if bleeding recurs. Band ligation involves the varices being sucked into a cap placed on the end of the endoscope, allowing them to be occluded with a tight rubber band. The occluded varix subsequently sloughs with variceal obliteration. Banding is repeated every 2–4 weeks until all varices are obliterated. Regular follow-up endoscopy is required to identify and treat any recurrence of varices. Band ligation has fewer side-effects than sclerotherapy, a technique in which varices are injected with a sclerosing agent, and has largely replaced it. Banding is best suited to the treatment of oesophageal varices. It is associated with a lower risk of oesophageal perforation or stricturing than sclerotherapy. Prophylactic acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors reduces the risk of secondary bleeding from banding-induced ulceration.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2560">In the case of gastric fundal varices, banding is less effective and so endoscopic therapy relies on injection of agents such as thrombin or cyanoacrylate glue directly into the varix to induce thrombosis.

Additional lumens allow contents to be aspirated from the stomach and from the oesophagus above the oesophageal balloon. This technique may be used in the event of life-threatening haemorrhage if early endoscopic therapy is not available or is unsuccessful.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2575">Endotracheal intubation prior to tube insertion reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration. The tube should be passed through the mouth and its presence in the stomach should be checked by auscultating the upper abdomen while injecting air and by confirming with radiology. The safest technique is to inflate the balloon in the stomach under direct endoscopic vision. Gentle traction is essential to maintain pressure on the varices. Initially, only the gastric balloon should be inflated, with 200–250 mL of air, as this will usually control bleeding. Inflation of the gastric balloon must be stopped if the patient experiences pain because inadvertent inflation in the oesophagus can cause oesophageal rupture. If the oesophageal balloon needs to be used because of continued bleeding, it should be deflated for about 10 minutes every 3 hours to avoid oesophageal mucosal damage. Pressure in the oesophageal balloon should be monitored with a sphygmomanometer and should not exceed 40 mmHg. Balloon tamponade will almost always stop oesophageal and gastric fundal variceal bleeding but is only a bridge to more definitive therapy.

It is carried out under radiological control via the internal jugular vein; prior patency of the portal vein must be determined angiographically, coagulation deficiencies may require correction with fresh frozen plasma, and antibiotic cover is provided. Successful shunt placement stops and prevents further variceal bleeding, and is an effective treatment for both oesophageal and gastric varices. Further bleeding necessitates investigation and treatment (e.g. angioplasty) because it is usually associated with shunt narrowing or occlusion.

The indication for treatment is a high viral load in the presence of active hepatitis, as demonstrated by elevated serum transaminases and/or histological evidence of inflammation and fibrosis.

These act by inhibiting the reverse transcription of pre-genomic RNA to HBV-DNA by HBV-DNA polymerase but do not directly affect the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) template for viral replication, and so relapse is common if treatment is withdrawn. One major concern is the selection of antiviral-resistant mutations with long-term treatment. This is particularly important with some of the older agents, such as lamivudine, as mutations induced by previous antiviral exposure may also induce resistance to newer agents. Entecavir and tenofovir (see below) are potent antivirals with a high barrier to genetic resistance and so are the most appropriate first-line agents.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0675"><ce:section-title id="st0630">Lamivudine</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2910">Although effective, long-term therapy is often complicated by the development of HBV-DNA polymerase mutants (e.g. the ‘YMDD variant’), which lead to viral resistance.

Both drugs have anti-HIV action and so their use as monotherapy is contraindicated in HIV-positive patients, as it may lead to HIV antiviral drug resistance. Current European guidelines advise that the other nucleoside/nucleotide antivirals should not be used as first-line monotherapy due to the induction of viral mutations, unless more potent drugs with a high barrier to resistance are not available or appropriate.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0685"><ce:section-title id="st0640">Interferon-alfa</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2920">This is most effective in patients with a low viral load and serum transaminases greater than twice the upper limit of normal, in whom it acts by augmenting a native immune response.

Response rates are lower in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, even when patients are given longer courses of treatment. Interferon is contraindicated in the presence of cirrhosis, as it may cause a rise in serum transaminases and precipitate liver failure. Longer-acting pegylated interferons that can be given once weekly have been evaluated in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis.

The immunosuppression that is seen in HIV infection can lead to loss of anti-HBs antibodies, reactivation of infection and a poorer antibody response to HBV vaccination.

Simultaneous infections give rise to acute hepatitis, which is often severe but is limited by recovery from the HBV infection. Infections in individuals who are chronic carriers of HBV can cause acute hepatitis with spontaneous recovery, and occasionally there is simultaneous cessation of the chronic HBV infection.

This antibody generally disappears within 2 months but persists in a few patients.

The infection is cured in more than 99% of patients who achieve an SVR. These newer drugs are extremely expensive, however, and so their use is placing substantial strain on the finite health-care resources of developed countries and has severely limited their availability in resource-poor settings.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3100">Until 2011, the treatment of choice was dual therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa, given as a weekly subcutaneous injection, together with oral ribavirin, a synthetic nucleotide analogue. Treatment was long – up to 12 months for genotype 1 infection, and both agents had significant side-effects that limited tolerability: ribavirin induces haemolytic anaemia and is teratogenic, while interferon induces influenza-like symptoms, irritability and depression, all of which can affect quality of life. As already mentioned, efficacy of these agents was poor (12 months' treatment for genotype 1 resulted in only a 40% SVR, rising to an SVR of over 70% for genotypes 2 or 3 after 6 months' treatment).</ce:para><ce:para id="p3105">Since 2011, new classes of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been developed.

Initially, DAAs were added to interferon-/ribavirin-based regimens; more recently, however, combinations of DAAs have increasingly been used in ‘interferon-free’ regimens. This maximises treatment efficacy by directly interfering with replication at multiple points in the viral life cycle without exposing patients to the side-effect profile of interferon-alfa therapy. For example, 12 weeks of treatment with oral sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir plus ribavirin can achieve a 99% SVR in treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients. Sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir achieves similar results and is pan-genotypic.

In a cohort of 1103 patients, no significant benefit from pentoxifylline treatment was identified but treatment with prednisolone (40 mg daily for 28 days) led to a modest reduction in short-term mortality, from 17% in placebo-treated patients to 14% in the prednisolone group. These findings were consistent with earlier studies where an improvement in 28-day survival from 52% to 78% is seen when glucocorticoids are given to those with a Glasgow score of more than 9. Neither glucocorticoids nor pentoxifylline improved survival at 90 days or 1 year, however.

Although this relates poorly to the incidence of alcohol relapse after transplantation, liver function may improve to the extent that transplantation is no longer necessary. The outcome of transplantation for ALD is good and if the patient remains abstinent there is no risk of disease recurrence.

Initially, prednisolone (40 mg/day) is given orally; the dose is then gradually reduced as the patient and LFTs improve. Maintenance therapy should only be instituted once LFTs are normal (as well as IgG if elevated). Approaches to maintenance include reduced-dose prednisolone (ideally, below 5–10 mg/day), usually in the context of azathioprine (1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day). Azathioprine can also be used as the sole maintenance immunosuppressive agent in patients with low-activity disease. Newer agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), are increasingly being used but formal evidence to inform practice in this area is lacking. Patients should be monitored for acute exacerbations (LFT and IgG screening with patients alerted to the possible symptoms) and such exacerbations should be treated with glucocorticoids.

AMA is directed at pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a mitochondrial enzyme complex that plays a key role in cellular energy generation. PBC-specific ANAs (such as those directed at the nuclear pore antigen gp210) have a characteristic staining pattern in immunofluorescence assays (selectively binding to the nuclear rim or nuclear dots), which means that they should not be mistaken for the homogenously staining ANA seen in autoimmune hepatitis.

Clinically, UDCA improves LFTs, may slow down histological progression and has few side-effects; it is therefore widely used in the treatment of PBC and should be regarded as the optimal first-line treatment. Its use is recommended in all clinical guidelines. A significant minority of patients either fail to normalise their LFTs with UDCA or show an inadequate response, and such individuals have an increased risk of developing end-stage liver disease compared to those showing a full response. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a second-generation bile acid therapeutic that acts as an agonist for the nuclear farnesoid X receptor. It reduces hepatocyte synthesis of bile acids and was approved in 2016 for use in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA. Immunosuppressants, such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, penicillamine and ciclosporin, have all been trialled in PBC. None shows overall benefit when given to unselected patients.

The role of screening in other forms of chronic liver disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis and PBC, is unclear.

The important organs involved are the liver, pancreatic islets, endocrine glands, joints and heart. In the liver, iron deposition occurs first in the periportal hepatocytes, extending later to all hepatocytes. The gradual development of fibrous septa leads to the formation of irregular nodules, and finally regeneration results in macronodular cirrhosis.

Approximately 90% of patients are homozygous for a single point mutation resulting in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at position 282 (C282Y) in the HFE protein, which has structural and functional similarity to the HLA proteins. The mechanisms by which HFE regulates iron absorption are unclear. It is believed, however, that HFE normally interacts with the transferrin receptor in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. In HHC, it is thought that the lack of functional HFE causes a defect in uptake of transferrin-associated iron, leading to up-regulation of enterocyte iron-specific divalent metal transporters and excessive iron absorption. A histidine-to-aspartic acid mutation at position 63 (H63D) in HFE causes a less severe form of haemochromatosis that is most commonly found in patients who are compound heterozygotes also carrying a C282Y mutated allele. Fewer than 50% of C282Y homozygotes will develop clinical features of haemochromatosis; therefore other factors must also be important. HHC may promote accelerated liver disease in patients with alcohol excess or hepatitis C infection.

Impotence, loss of libido and testicular atrophy are recognised complications, as are early-onset osteoarthritis targeting unusual sites such as the metacarpophalangeal joints, chondrocalcinosis and pseudogout.

Other therapy includes that for cirrhosis and diabetes. First-degree family members should be investigated, preferably by genetic screening and also by checking the plasma ferritin and iron-binding saturation. Liver biopsy is indicated in asymptomatic relatives only if the LFTs are abnormal and/or the serum ferritin is greater than 1000 µg/L (100 µg/dL) because these features are associated with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.

The cause can range from inherited or acquired dysfunction of transporter molecules responsible for the production of canalicular bile to physical obstruction of the extrahepatic bile duct. ‘Biliary disease’ relates to pathology at any level from the small intrahepatic bile ducts to the sphincter of Oddi. Although there is very significant overlap between cholestatic and biliary disease, there are scenarios where cholestasis can exist without biliary disease (transporter disease or pure drug-induced cholestasis) and where biliary disease can exist without cholestasis (when disease of the bile duct does not impact on bile flow).

In individuals under 40 years there is a 3 : 1 female preponderance, whereas in the elderly the sex ratio is about equal. Gallstones are less frequent in India, the Far East and Africa.

Typically, the pain occurs suddenly and persists for about 2 hours; if it continues for more than 6 hours, a complication such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis may be present. Pain is usually felt in the epigastrium (70% of patients) or right upper quadrant (20%) and radiates to the interscapular region or the tip of the right scapula, but other sites include the left upper quadrant and the lower chest.

Rarely, fistulae develop between the gallbladder and the duodenum, colon or stomach. If this occurs, air will be seen in the biliary tree on plain abdominal X-rays. If a stone larger than 2.5 cm in diameter has migrated into the gut, it may impact either at the terminal ileum or occasionally in the duodenum or sigmoid colon. The resultant intestinal obstruction may be followed by ‘gallstone ileus’. Gallstones impacted in the cystic duct may cause stricturing of the common hepatic duct and the clinical picture of extrahepatic biliary diseases (‘Mirizzi's syndrome’, with its important differential of malignant bile duct stricture). The more common cause of jaundice due to gallstones is a stone passing from the cystic duct into the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis), which may also result in cholangitis or acute pancreatitis. It is usually very small stones that precipitate acute pancreatitis, due (it is thought) to oedema at the ampulla as the stone passes into the duodenum (no stone is seen within the bile duct in 80% of cases of presumed gallstone pancreatitis, suggesting stone passage).

This leads to gallbladder mucosal damage, which releases phospholipase, converting biliary lecithin to lysolecithin, a recognised mucosal toxin. At the time of surgery, approximately 50% of cultures of the gallbladder contents are sterile.

Jaundice, fever (with or without rigors) and right upper quadrant pain are the main presenting features (‘Charcot's triad’). Treatment is with antibiotics, relief of biliary obstruction and removal (if possible) of the underlying cause.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1695"><ce:section-title id="st1590">Choledocholithiasis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5125">Stones in the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis) occur in 10–15% of patients with gallstones (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1250" refid="f0255">Fig. 22.45</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0255"/>), which have usually migrated from the gallbladder. Primary bile duct stones are rare but can develop within the common bile duct many years after a cholecystectomy, and are sometimes related to biliary sludge arising from dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi. In Far Eastern countries, primary common bile duct stones are thought to follow bacterial infection secondary to parasitic infections with <ce:italic>Clonorchis sinensis</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</ce:italic> or <ce:italic>Fasciola hepatica</ce:italic> (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0525" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00011-1#s2740">pp. 297 and 289</ce:intra-ref>).

The pain is usually in the right upper quadrant, and fever, pruritus and dark urine may be present. Rigors may be a feature; jaundice is common and usually associated with pain. Physical examination may show the scar of a previous cholecystectomy; if the gallbladder is present, it is usually small, fibrotic and impalpable.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1710"><ce:section-title id="st1600">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5135">The LFTs show a cholestatic pattern and there is bilirubinuria. If cholangitis is present, the patient usually has a leucocytosis. The most convenient method of demonstrating obstruction to the common bile duct is transabdominal ultrasound. This shows dilated extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, together with gallbladder stones (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1255" refid="f0260">Fig. 22.46</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0260"/>), but does not always reveal the cause of the obstruction in the common bile duct; 50% of bile duct stones are missed on ultrasound, particularly those in the distal common bile duct. EUS is extremely accurate at identifying bile duct stones. MRCP is non-invasive and is indicated when intervention is not necessarily mandatory (e.g. the patient with possible bile duct stones but no jaundice or sepsis).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1715"><ce:section-title id="st1605">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5140">Cholangitis should be treated with analgesia, intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cefuroxime and metronidazole (local prescribing practice may vary). Blood cultures should be taken before the antibiotics are administered. Patients also require urgent decompression of the biliary tree and stone removal. ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy and stone extraction is the treatment of choice and is successful in about 90% of patients. If ERCP fails, other approaches include percutaneous transhepatic drainage and combined (‘rendezvous’) endoscopic procedures, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and surgery.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5145">Surgical treatment of choledocholithiasis is performed less frequently than ERCP, and before the common bile duct is explored the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis should be confirmed by intraoperative cholangiography. If gallstones are found, the bile duct is explored, either via the cystic duct or by opening it, all stones are removed, clearance is checked by cholangiography or choledochoscopy, and then primary closure of the duct is performed if possible. External drainage of the common bile duct by T-tube is rarely required nowadays. It is now possible to achieve these goals laparoscopically in specialist centres.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1720"><ce:section-title id="st1610">Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5150">This disease occurs predominantly in South-east Asia. Biliary sludge, calcium bilirubinate concretions and stones accumulate in the intrahepatic bile ducts, with secondary bacterial infection. Patients present with recurrent attacks of upper abdominal pain, fever and cholestatic jaundice. Investigation of the biliary tree demonstrates that both the intrahepatic and the extrahepatic portions are filled with soft biliary mud. Eventually, the liver becomes scarred and liver abscesses and secondary biliary cirrhosis develop. The condition is difficult to manage and requires drainage of the biliary tract with extraction of stones, antibiotics and, in certain patients, partial resection of damaged areas of the liver.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1725"><ce:section-title id="st1615">Tumours of the gallbladder and bile duct</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s1730"><ce:section-title id="st1620">Carcinoma of the gallbladder</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5155">This is an uncommon tumour, occurring more often in females and usually in those over the age of 70 years. More than 90% are adenocarcinomas; the remainder are anaplastic or, rarely, squamous tumours. Gallstones are present in 70–80% of cases and are thought to be important in the aetiology of the tumour. Individuals with a calcified gallbladder (‘porcelain gallbladder’; <ce:cross-ref id="crf9255" refid="s1615">p. 904</ce:cross-ref>) are at high risk of malignant change, and gallbladder polyps over 1 cm in size are associated with increased risk of malignancy; preventative cholecystectomy should be considered in such patients. Chronic infection with <ce:italic>Salmonella</ce:italic>, especially in areas where typhoid is endemic, is also a risk factor.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5160">Carcinoma of the gallbladder may be diagnosed incidentally and is found in 1–3% of gallbladders removed at cholecystectomy for gallstone disease. It may manifest as repeated attacks of biliary pain and, later, persistent jaundice and weight loss. A gallbladder mass may be palpable in the right hypochondrium. LFTs show cholestasis, and porcelain gallbladder may be found on X-ray. The tumour can be diagnosed by ultrasonography and staged by CT. The treatment is surgical excision but local extension of the tumour beyond the wall of the gallbladder into the liver, lymph nodes and surrounding tissues is invariable and palliative management is usually all that can be offered. Survival is generally short, death typically occurring within 1 year in patients presenting with symptoms.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1735"><ce:section-title id="st1625">Cholangiocarcinoma</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5165">Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon tumour that can arise anywhere in the biliary tree, from the intrahepatic bile ducts (20–25% of cases) and the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts at the liver hilum (50–60%) to the distal common bile duct (20%). It accounts for only 1.5% of all cancers but the incidence is increasing. The cause is unknown but the tumour is associated with gallstones, primary and secondary sclerosing cholangitis, Caroli's disease and choledochal cysts (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1260" refid="f0245">Fig. 22.43</ce:cross-ref>). In the Far East, particularly northern Thailand, chronic liver fluke infection (<ce:italic>Clonorchis sinensis</ce:italic>) is a major risk factor for the development of CCA in men. Primary sclerosing cholangitis carries a lifetime risk of CCA of approximately 20%, although only 5% of CCAs relate to primary sclerosing cholangitis. Chronic biliary inflammation appears to be a common factor in the development of biliary dysplasia and cancer that is shared by all the predisposing causes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5170">Tumours typically invade the lymphatics and adjacent vessels, with a predilection for spread within perineural sheaths. The presentation is usually with obstructive jaundice. About 50% of patients also have upper abdominal pain and weight loss. The diagnosis is made using a combination of CT and MRI (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf9015" refid="f0080">Fig. 22.10</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9260" refid="s0205">p. 855</ce:cross-ref>) but can be difficult to confirm in patients with sclerosing cholangitis. Serum levels of the tumour marker CA19-9 are elevated in up to 80% of cases, although this may occur in biliary obstruction of any cause. In the setting of biliary obstruction, ERCP may result in positive biliary cytology. Endoscopic ultrasound–fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of bile duct masses is sometimes possible, and in specialist centres single-operator cholangioscopy with biopsy is now established. CCAs can be treated surgically in about 20% of patients, which improves 5-year survival from less than 5% to 20–40%. Surgery involves excision of the extrahepatic biliary tree with or without a liver resection and a Roux loop reconstruction. However, most patients are treated by stent insertion across the malignant biliary stricture, using endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic techniques (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1265" refid="f0265">Fig. 22.47</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0265"/>).

Jaundice may be intermittent or persistent. The diagnosis is made by duodenal endoscopy and biopsy of the tumour but staging by CT/MRI and EUS is essential. Ampullary carcinoma must be differentiated from carcinoma of the head of the pancreas and a CCA because these last two conditions both have a worse prognosis. Imaging may show a ‘double duct sign’ with stricturing of both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct at the ampulla and upstream dilatation of the ducts. EUS is the most sensitive method of assessing and staging ampullary or periampullary tumours.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5180">Curative surgical treatment can be undertaken by pan­creaticoduodenectomy and the 5-year survival may be as high as 50%.
