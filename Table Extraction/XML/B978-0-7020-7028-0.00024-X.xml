This begins by removal of old and damaged bone by osteoclasts during the phase of bone resorption. After about 10â€¯days, the osteoclasts undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) and during the reversal phase are replaced by osteoblasts, which begin to fill in the resorbed area with new bone matrix, heralding the start of bone formation. The bone matrix is initially uncalcified (osteoid) but then becomes mineralised to form mature bone.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0015" role="short">Fig. 24.2</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0025" locator="f024-002-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B978070207028000024X/f024-002-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0030"><ce:label>Fig. 24.3</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0020"><ce:simple-para id="sp0025" role="title">Cellular and molecular regulators of bone remodelling</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0030" role="caption">Osteoclast precursors are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. They differentiate into mature osteoclasts in response to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which is produced by osteocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts and activated T cells (not shown), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is produced by bone marrow stromal cells. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is also produced in the bone microenvironment, where it inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption by blocking the effect of RANKL. Osteoblasts, which are derived from bone marrow stromal cells, are responsible for bone formation. Osteoblast activity is stimulated by signalling molecules in the Wnt family but inhibited by sclerostin (SOST), which is produced by osteocytes. In addition to their role in regulating osteoclast and osteoblast activity, osteocytes have an endocrine function in regulating phosphate homeostasis by producing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which acts on the kidney to promote phosphate excretion.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0020" role="short">Fig. 24.3</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0030" locator="f024-003-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B978070207028000024X/f024-003-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0035"><ce:label>Fig. 24.4</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0025"><ce:simple-para id="sp0040" role="title">Structure of a synovial joint.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0025" role="short">Fig. 24.4</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0045" locator="f024-004-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B978070207028000024X/f024-004-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0040"><ce:label>Fig. 24.5</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0030"><ce:simple-para id="sp0045" role="title">Ultrastructure of articular cartilage.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0030" role="short">Fig. 24.5</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0050" locator="f024-005-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B978070207028000024X/f024-005-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0045"><ce:label>Fig. 24.6</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0035"><ce:simple-para id="sp0050" role="title">Compensated polarised light microscopy of synovial fluids (Ã—â€‰400).</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0055" role="caption"><ce:bold>A</ce:bold> Monosodium urate crystals show bright negative birefringence under polarised light and needle-shaped morphology. <ce:bold>B</ce:bold> Calcium pyrophosphate crystals show weak positive birefringence under polarised light and are few in number.

These cells produce increased amounts of interleukin 23 (IL-23), which acts on T cells, neutrophils and mast cells to make IL-17; IL-17 in turn has a pivotal role in driving inflammation, causing sacroiliitis and enthesitis. Presentation of antigen by dendritic cells also plays a pathogenic part in activating T cells, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), produced by macrophages and activated T cells, contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation. Production of IL-22 by T cells is thought to be involved in causing the new bone formation that is typical of axial spondyloarthropathy.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0195" role="short">Fig. 24.38</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0530" locator="f024-038-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B978070207028000024X/f024-038-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0210"><ce:label>Fig. 24.39</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0210"><ce:simple-para id="sp0430" role="title">Magnetic resonance imaging appearances in sacroiliitis.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0435" role="caption">Coronal MRI short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequence showing bilateral sacroiliitis in axial spondyloarthritis.

Flat bones, such as the skull, develop by intramembranous ossification, in which embryonic fibroblasts differentiate directly into bone within condensations of mesenchymal tissue during early fetal life. Long bones, such as the femur and radius, develop by endochondral ossification from a cartilage template. During development, the cartilage is invaded by vascular tissue containing osteoprogenitor cells and is gradually replaced by bone from centres of ossification situated in the middle and at the ends of the bone. A thin remnant of cartilage called the growth plate or epiphysis remains at each end of long bones, and chondrocyte proliferation here is responsible for skeletal growth during childhood and adolescence. At the end of puberty, the increased levels of sex hormones halt cell division in the growth plate. The cartilage remnant then disappears as the epiphysis fuses and longitudinal bone growth ceases.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0295">Two types of bone tissue are present in the normal skeleton (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0270" refid="f0020">Fig. 24.1</ce:cross-ref>). Cortical bone is formed from Haversian systems, comprising concentric lamellae of bone tissue surrounding a central canal that contains blood vessels. Cortical bone is dense and forms a hard envelope around the long bones. Trabecular or cancellous bone fills the centre of the bone and consists of an interconnecting meshwork of trabeculae, separated by spaces filled with bone marrow.

Type I collagen is proteolytically processed inside the cell before being laid down in the extracellular space, releasing propeptide fragments that can be used as biochemical markers of bone formation. Subsequently, the collagen fibrils become â€˜cross-linkedâ€™ to one another by pyridinium molecules, a process that enhances bone strength. When bone is broken down by osteoclasts, the cross-links are released into the circulation. These can be measured biochemically and are sometimes used clinically to assess levels of bone resorption. Bone is normally laid down in an orderly fashion, but when bone turnover is high, as in Paget's disease or severe hyperparathyroidism, it is laid down in a chaotic pattern, giving rise to â€˜woven boneâ€™ that is mechanically weak. Bone matrix also contains growth factors, other structural proteins and proteoglycans, thought to be involved in helping bone cells attach to bone matrix and in regulating bone cell activity. The other major component of bone is mineral, comprised of calcium and phosphate crystals deposited between the collagen fibrils in the form of hydroxyapatite [Ca<ce:inf loc="post">10</ce:inf> (PO<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf>)<ce:inf loc="post">6</ce:inf> (OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>]. Mineralisation is essential for bone's rigidity and strength but over-mineralisation causes the bone to become brittle. In clinical practice, increased mineralisation can occur in some types of osteogenesis imperfecta and in response to long-term bisphosphonate therapy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Bone remodelling</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0330">Bone remodelling is required for renewal and repair of the skeleton throughout life. This is a cyclical process that has four phases; quiescence, resorption, reversal and formation, as illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0275" refid="f0025">Figure 24.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>. Remodelling starts with the attraction of osteoclast precursors in peripheral blood to the target site, probably by local release of chemotactic factors from areas of microdamage. The osteoclasts resorb bone and, after about 10â€¯days, undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), heralding the start of the reversal phase, when osteoblast precursors are recruited to the resorption site. The osteoblast precursors differentiate into mature osteoblasts and form new bone during the formation phase. Initially, the matrix is unmineralised (osteoid) but eventually becomes mineralised to form mature bone. Some osteoblasts become trapped in bone matrix and differentiate into osteocytes, which play a key regulatory role in coordinating bone formation and resorption, whereas others differentiate into bone-lining cells.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0335">The cellular and molecular mediators of this bone remodelling are shown in more detail in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0280" refid="f0030">Figure 24.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>. Osteoclast precursors are derived from haematopoietic stem cells and differentiate into mature osteoclasts in response to M-CSF, produced by bone marrow stromal cells, and RANKL, produced by osteocytes, bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts. The RANKL binds to and activates a receptor called RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B) on osteoclast precursors, promoting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. This effect is blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which is a decoy receptor for RANKL that inhibits osteoclast formation. Once formed, mature osteoclasts attach to the bone surface by a tight sealing zone and secrete hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes, including cathepsin K, into the space underneath, which is known as the Howship's lacuna. The acid dissolves the mineral and cathepsin K degrades collagen. Osteocytes also produce sclerostin (SOST), which is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Under conditions of mechanical loading, sclerostin production by osteocytes is inhibited, allowing bone formation to proceed, stimulated by members of the Wnt family of signalling proteins. The Wnt molecules stimulate bone formation by activating members of the lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family, the most important of which are LRP4, LRP5 and LRP6. Sclerostin antagonises the effects of Wnt family members by blocking their interaction with LRP family members. Finally, osteocytes play a critical role in phosphate homeostasis by producing the hormone FGF23, which regulates renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. Key regulators of bone remodelling are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0285" refid="b0010">Box 24.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0345">Mineralisation of bone is critically dependent on the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is produced by osteoblasts and degrades pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralisation.

Cartilage cells (chondrocytes) are responsible for synthesis and turnover of cartilage, which consists of a mesh of type II collagen fibrils that extend through a hydrated â€˜gelâ€™ of proteoglycan molecules. The most important proteoglycan is aggrecan, which consists of a core protein to which several glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains are attached (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0305" refid="f0040">Fig. 24.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0040"/>). The GAGs are polysaccharides that consist of long chains of disaccharide repeats comprising one normal sugar and an amino sugar. The most abundant GAGs in aggrecan are chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate. Hyaluronan is another important GAG that binds to aggrecan molecules to form very large complexes with a total molecular weight of more than 100â€¯million. Aggrecan has a strong negative charge and avidly binds water molecules to assume a shape that occupies the maximum possible volume available. The expansive force of the hydrated aggrecan, combined with the restrictive strength of the collagen mesh, gives articular cartilage excellent shock-absorbing properties.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0375">With ageing, the concentration of chondroitin sulphate decreases, whereas that of keratan sulphate increases, resulting in reduced water content and shock-absorbing properties. These changes differ from those found in osteoarthritis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9070" refid="s0580">p. 1007</ce:cross-ref>), where there is abnormal chondrocyte division, loss of proteoglycan from matrix and an increase in water content. Cartilage matrix is constantly turning over and in health there is a perfect balance between synthesis and degradation. Degradation of cartilage matrix is carried out by aggrecanases and matrix metalloproteinases, responsible for the breakdown of proteins and proteoglycans, and by glycosidases, responsible for the breakdown of GAGs. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which are released during inflammation, stimulate production of aggrecanase and metalloproteinases, causing cartilage degradation.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Synovial fluid</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0380">The surfaces of articular cartilage are separated by a space filled with synovial fluid (SF), a viscous liquid that lubricates the joint.

Turbid fluid with a high neutrophil count occurs in sepsis, crystal arthritis and reactive arthritis. High concentrations of urate crystals or cholesterol can make SF appear white. Non-uniform blood-staining usually reflects needle trauma to the synovium.

DXA works on the principle that calcium in bone attenuates passage of X-rays through the tissue in proportion to the amount of mineral present: the more bone mineral present, the higher the BMD value. Bone density measurements are often presented as T-scores, which measure of the number of standard deviations by which the patient's BMD value differs from that in a young healthy control (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0370" refid="f0060">Fig. 24.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0060"/>).

Gout classically affects the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, whereas pseudogout, which can be a presenting feature of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) disease, can affect the hand/wrist, ankle, knee or hip. A very rapid onset (6â€“12â€¯hours) is suggestive of crystal arthritis; joint sepsis develops more slowly and continues to progress until treated. Haemarthrosis typically causes a large effusion, in the absence of periarticular swelling or skin change, in a patient who has suffered an injury. Pigmented villonodular synovitis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9115" refid="s2005">p. 1059</ce:cross-ref>) also presents with synovial swelling and a large effusion, although the onset is gradual. A previous diarrhoeal illness or genital infection suggests reactive arthritis, whereas intercurrent illness, dehydration or surgery may act as a trigger for crystal-induced arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis seldom presents with monoarthritis but psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can typically present this way.

Mechanical back pain is the most common cause of acute back pain in people aged 20â€“55. This accounts for more than 90% of episodes, and is usually acute and associated with lifting or bending. It is exacerbated by activity and is generally relieved by rest (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0475" refid="b0095">Box 24.18</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0095"/>). It is usually confined to the lumbarâ€“sacral region, buttock or thigh, is asymmetrical and does not radiate beyond the knee (which would imply nerve root irritation). On examination, there may be asymmetric local paraspinal muscle spasm and tenderness, and painful restriction of some, but not all, movements. Low back pain is more common in manual workers, particularly those in occupations that involve heavy lifting and twisting. The prognosis is generally good. After 2â€¯days, 30% are better and 90% have recovered by 6â€¯weeks. Recurrences of pain may occur and about 10â€“15% of patients go on to develop chronic back pain that may be difficult to treat.

Spinal stenosis presents insidiously with leg discomfort on walking that is relieved by rest, bending forwards or walking uphill.

Prolapse of an intervertebral disc presents when discs are still well hydrated (in young and early middle age) with nerve root pain, which can be accompanied by a sensory deficit, motor weakness and asymmetrical reflexes. Examination may reveal a positive sciatic or femoral stretch test. About 70% of patients improve by 4â€¯weeks. Inflammatory back pain (IBP) due to axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or PsA has a gradual onset and almost always occurs before the age of 40. It is associated with morning stiffness and improves with movement. Spondylolisthesis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9155" refid="s2005">p. 1059</ce:cross-ref>) may cause back pain that is typically aggravated by standing and walking.

Inflammatory arthritis of either of these joints (RA, PsA, CPPD arthritis or gout) often worsens and swells with rest. These diagnoses can be associated with hindfoot tenosynovitis (peroneal or posterior tibial). Pain under the heel is typically due to plantar fasciitis. This can occur as the result of overuse, which case it may respond to rest, padded footwear and local glucocorticoid injections, but can also arise in SpA as a manifestation of enthesitis. Pain affecting the back of the heel may be due to Achilles tendinitis or enthesitis. The MTP joints of the feet are commonly involved symmetrically in RA. The presentation is with pain on walking felt below the metatarsal heads, often described as â€˜walking on marblesâ€™. Patients with active inflammation of the MTP joints have pain when the forefoot is squeezed (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9175" refid="s0010">p. 982</ce:cross-ref>). Involvement of the first MTP joint is common in OA or PsA and is associated, respectively, with hallux valgus and dactylitis. The hallux also a classical target in acute gout. Morton's neuroma is a neuropathy of an interdigital nerve and is usually located between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. Women are most commonly affected (tight shoes can be to blame). Local sensory loss and a palpable tender swelling between the metatarsal heads may be detected. Footwear adjustment, with or without a local glucocorticoid injection, often helps but surgical decompression may be required if symptoms persist.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0395"><ce:section-title id="st0365">Muscle pain and weakness</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1645">Muscle pain and weakness can arise from a variety of causes.

The main approaches for damaged joints are osteotomy (cutting bone to alter joint mechanics and load transmission), excision arthroplasty (removing part or all of the joint), joint replacement (insertion of prosthesis in place of the excised joint) and arthrodesis (joint fusion).

It is thought to work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the brain while having little effect on peripheral prostaglandin production. It is well tolerated and has few adverse effects and drug interactions. An increased risk of gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular disease has been reported with chronic usage in observational studies, but this may be due to channelling of patients at higher risk of these events for treatment with paracetamol rather than NSAID. Paracetamol can be combined with codeine (co-codamol) or dihydrocodeine (co-dydramol). These compound analgesics are more effective than paracetamol but have more side-effects, including constipation, headache and delirium, especially in the elderly. The centrally acting opioid analgesics tramadol and meptazinol may be useful for temporary control of severe pain unresponsive to other measures but can cause nausea, bowel upset, dizziness and somnolence, and withdrawal symptoms after chronic use. The non-opioid analgesic nefopam (30â€“90â€¯mg 3 times daily) can help moderate pain, though side-effects (nausea, anxiety, dry mouth) often limit its use.

Oral NSAIDs are useful in the treatment of a range of rheumatic diseases with an inflammatory component. There is variability in response and patients who do not gain benefit from one NSAID may well do so with another. They inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin H synthase enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid, derived from membrane phospholipids, to prostaglandins and leukotrienes by the COX and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, respectively (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0565" refid="f0085">Fig. 24.14</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0085"/>). There are two COX isoforms, encoded by different genes. The COX-1 enzyme is constitutively expressed in gastric mucosa, platelets and kidneys, and production of prostaglandins at these sites protects against mucosal damage and regulates platelet aggregation and renal blood flow. The COX-2 enzyme is induced at sites of inflammation, producing prostaglandins that cause local pain and swelling. Inflammation also up-regulates COX-2 in the spinal cord, where it modulates pain perception. Ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen are non-selective drugs that inhibit both COX enzymes, whereas celecoxib and etoricoxib are selective inhibitors of COX-2. While NSAIDs have anti-inflammatory activity, they are not thought to have a disease-modifying effect in either OA or inflammatory rheumatic diseases.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2110">Non-selective NSAIDs can damage the gastric and duodenal mucosal barrier and are associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding and perforation. The adjusted increased risk (odds ratio) of bleeding or perforation from non-selective NSAIDs is 4â€“5, though differences exist between NSAIDs (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0570" refid="b0155">Box 24.30</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0155"/>).

The COX-2 selective NSAIDs are much less likely to cause gastrointestinal toxicity but benefit is attenuated in patients on low-dose aspirin. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines advise that a PPI should be co-prescribed with all NSAIDs, including COX-2-selective NSAIDs, even though the risk of gastrointestinal events with these is low. Since chronic PPI therapy is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, the merits of giving PPI therapy with a COX-2-selective drug need to be weighed up carefully.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2155">Other side-effects of NSAIDs include fluid retention and renal impairment due to inhibition of renal prostaglandin production, non-ulcer-associated dyspepsia, abdominal pain and altered bowel habit, and rashes.

Although some are asymptomatic, the lifetime risk of having a total hip or knee replacement for OA in someone aged 50 is about 11% for women and 8% for men in the UK. There are major ethnic differences in susceptibility: the prevalence of hip OA is lower in Africa, China, Japan and the Indian subcontinent than in European countries, and that of knee OA is higher.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0630"><ce:section-title id="st0585">Pathophysiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2360">OA is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental components (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0635" refid="b0185">Box 24.36</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0185"/>). Genetic factors are recognised as playing a key role in the pathogenesis of OA. Family-based studies have estimated that the heritability of OA ranges from about 43% at the knee to between 60% and 65% at the hip and hand, respectively. In most cases, the inheritance is polygenic and mediated by several genetic variants of small effect. OA can, however, be a component of multiple epiphyseal dysplasias, which are caused by mutations in the genes that encode components of cartilage matrix. Structural abnormalities, such as slipped femoral epiphysis and developmental dysplasia of the hip, are also associated with a high risk of OA, presumably due to abnormal load distribution across the joint. Similar mechanisms probably explain the increased risk of OA in patients with limb deformity secondary to Paget's disease of bone. Biomechanical factors play an important role in OA related to certain occupations, such as farmers (hip OA), miners (knee OA) and elite or professional athletes (knee and ankle OA). It has been speculated that the higher prevalence of knee OA in the Indian subcontinent and East Asia might be accounted for by squatting. There is also a high risk of OA in people who have had destabilising injuries, such as cruciate ligament rupture, and those who have had meniscetomy. For most individuals, however, participation in recreational sport does not appear to increase the risk significantly. There is a strong association between obesity and OA, particularly of the hip. This is thought to be due partly to biomechanical factors but it has also been speculated that cytokines released from adipose tissue may play a role. Oestrogen appears to play a role; lower rates of OA have been observed in women who use hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and women who receive aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer often experience a flare in symptoms of OA.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2460">Degeneration of articular cartilage is the defining feature of OA. Under normal circumstances, chondrocytes are terminally differentiated cells but in OA they start dividing to produce nests of metabolically active cells (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0640" refid="f0095">Fig. 24.16A</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0095"/>). Initially, matrix components are produced by these cells at an increased rate, but at the same time there is accelerated degradation of the major structural components of cartilage matrix, including aggrecan and type II collagen (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0645" refid="f0040">Fig. 24.5</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9200" refid="s0055">p. 987</ce:cross-ref>). Eventually, the concentration of aggrecan in cartilage matrix falls and makes the cartilage vulnerable to load-bearing injury. Fissuring of the cartilage surface (â€˜fibrillationâ€™) then occurs, leading to the development of deep vertical clefts (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0650" refid="f0095">Fig. 24.16B</ce:cross-ref>), localised chondrocyte death and decreased cartilage thickness. This is initially focal, mainly targeting the maximum load-bearing part of the joint, but eventually large parts of the cartilage surface are damaged. Calcium pyrophosphate and basic calcium phosphate crystals often become deposited in the abnormal cartilage.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2465">OA is also accompanied by abnormalities in subchondral bone, which becomes sclerotic and the site of subchondral cysts (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0655" refid="f0095">Fig. 24.16C</ce:cross-ref>). Fibrocartilage is produced at the joint margin, which undergoes endochondral ossification to form osteophytes. Bone remodelling and cartilage thinning slowly alter the shape of the OA joint, increasing its surface area. It is almost as though there is a homeostatic mechanism operative in OA that causes enlargement of the failing joint to spread the mechanical load over a greater surface area.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2470">Patients with OA also have higher BMD values at sites distant from the joint and this is particularly associated with osteophyte formation. This is in keeping with observations made in epidemiological studies that show that patients with OA are partially protected from developing osteoporosis and vice versa. This is likely to be due to the fact that the genetic factors that predispose to osteoporosis might be protective for OA.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2475">The synovium in OA is often hyperplastic and may be the site of inflammatory change, but to a much lesser extent than in RA and other inflammatory arthropathies. Osteochondral bodies commonly occur within the synovium, reflecting chondroid metaplasia or secondary uptake and growth of damaged cartilage fragments. The outer capsule also thickens and contracts, usually retaining the stability of the remodelling joint. The muscles surrounding affected joints commonly show evidence of wasting and non-specific type II fibre atrophy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0660"><ce:section-title id="st0615">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2480">OA has a characteristic distribution, mainly targeting the hips, knees, PIP and DIP joints of the hands, neck and lumbar spine (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0660" refid="f0065">Fig. 24.10</ce:cross-ref>). The main presenting symptoms are pain and functional restriction. The causes of pain in OA are not completely understood but may relate to increased pressure in subchondral bone (mainly causing night pain), trabecular microfractures, capsular distension and low-grade synovitis. Pain may also result from bursitis and enthesopathy secondary to altered joint mechanics. Typical OA pain has the characteristics listed in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0665" refid="b0190">Box 24.37</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0190"/>.

It is stronger at the hip than at the knee, and poor at most small joints. This suggests that the risk factors for pain and disability may differ from those for structural change.

Some patients are asymptomatic whereas others develop pain, stiffness and swelling of one or more PIP and DIP joints of the hands from the age of about 40â€¯years onwards.

Typically, each joint goes through a phase of episodic symptoms (1â€“5â€¯years) while the node evolves and OA develops. Once OA is fully established, symptoms may subside and hand function often remains good. Affected joints are enlarged as a result of osteophyte formation and often show characteristic lateral deviation, reflecting the asymmetric focal cartilage loss of OA (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0680" refid="f0105">Fig. 24.18</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0105"/>).

In addition to providing diagnostic information, X-rays are of value in assessing the severity of structural change, which is helpful if joint replacement surgery is being considered. Non-weight-bearing postero-anterior views of the pelvis are adequate for assessing hip OA. Patients with suspected knee OA should have standing anteroposterior X-rays taken to assess tibio-femoral cartilage loss, and a flexed skyline view to assess patello-femoral involvement.

Although surgery should not be undertaken at an early stage during the development of OA, it is important to consider it before functional limitation has become advanced since this may compromise outcome.

Crystals can be the primary pathogenic agent, as in gout, or an accessory factor, as in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, in which crystals are deposited in joints that are already abnormal. Several factors influence crystal formation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0730" refid="f0130">Fig. 24.23</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0130"/>). There must be sufficient concentration of the chemical components (ionic product), but whether a crystal then forms depends on the balance of tissue factors that promote and inhibit crystal nucleation and growth. The inflammatory potential of crystals resides in their physical irregularity and high negative surface charge, which can induce inflammation and damage cell membranes. Crystals may also cause mechanical damage to tissues and act as wear particles at the joint surface. They can reside in cartilage or tendon for years without causing inflammation or symptoms, and it is only when they are released that they trigger inflammation. This may occur spontaneously but can also result from local trauma, rapid changes in the concentration of the components that form crystals, or in association with an acute phase response triggered by intercurrent illness or surgery. In the longer term, a reduction in concentrations of the solutes that form crystals causes dissolution of crystals and remission of the arthritis.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0765"><ce:section id="s0770"><ce:section-title id="st0720">Gout</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p2890">Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in men and in older women.

The risk of developing gout increases with age and with serum uric acid (SUA) levels. These are normally distributed in the general population and hyperuricaemia is defined as an SUA of more than 2 standard deviations above the mean for the population. SUA levels are higher in men, increase with age and are positively associated with body weight. Levels are higher in some ethnic groups (such as Maoris and Pacific islanders).

The concentration of uric acid in body fluids depends on the balance between endogenous synthesis, and elimination by the kidneys (two-thirds) and gut (one-third). Purine nucleotide synthesis and degradation are regulated by a network of enzyme pathways, but xanthine oxidase plays a pivotal role in catalysing the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2905">The causes of hyperuricaemia are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0740" refid="b0215">Box 24.42</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0215"/>. In over 90% of patients, the main abnormality is reduced uric acid excretion by the kidney, which is genetically determined. Impaired renal excretion of urate also accounts for the occurrence of hyperuricaemia in chronic renal failure, and for hyperuricaemia associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3020">Other risk factors for gout include metabolic syndrome, high alcohol intake (predominantly beer, which contains guanosine), generalised OA, and a diet relatively high in game, offal, seafood, red meat and fructose, or low in vitamin C.

The association between OA and gout is thought to be due to a reduction in levels of proteoglycan and other inhibitors of crystal formation in osteoarthritic cartilage, predisposing to crystal formation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3025">Some patients develop gout because they over-produce uric acid.

The importance of genetic factors is demonstrated by higher concordance of RA in monozygotic (12â€“15%) compared with dizygotic twins (3%), and an increased frequency of disease in first-degree relatives of patients. Genome-wide association studies have detected nearly 100 loci that are associated with the risk of developing RA. The strongest association is with variants in the HLA region. Recent studies have shown that the association with HLA is determined by variations in three amino acids in the HLA-DRÎ²1 molecule (positions 11, 71 and 74) and single variants HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPÎ²1 (at position 9). The non-HLA loci generally lie within or close to genes involved in regulating the immune response. It is currently believed that RA occurs when an environmental stimulus, such as infection, triggers autoimmunity in a genetically susceptible host by modifying host proteins through processes like citrullination so that they become immunogenic. However, no single specific pathogen has been identified as a cause. An important environmental risk factor is cigarette smoking, which is also associated with more severe disease and reduced responsiveness to treatment. Remission may occur during pregnancy and sometimes RA first presents post-partum. This is likely to be due to suppression of the immune response during pregnancy but hormonal changes may also play a role.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3675">The disease is characterised by infiltration of the synovial membrane with lymphocytes, plasma cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. There is evidence that CD4<ce:sup loc="post">+</ce:sup> T lymphocytes and B cells play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA by interacting with other cells in the synovium, as illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0895" refid="f0175">Figure 24.32</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0175"/>. Lymphoid follicles form within the synovial membrane in which T- and B-cell interactions occur, causing activation of T cells to produce cytokines and activation of B cells to produce autoantibodies, including RF and ACPA. Synovial macrophages are activated by TNF and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), produced by T cells. The macrophages produce several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, which act on synovial fibroblasts to produce further cytokines, setting up a positive feedback loop. The synovial fibroblasts proliferate, causing synovial hypertrophy and producing matrix metalloproteinases and the proteinase ADAMTS-5, which degrade soft tissues and cartilage. Prostaglandins and nitric oxide produced within the inflamed synovium cause vasodilatation, resulting in swelling and pain. Systemic release of IL-6 triggers production of acute phase proteins by the liver. At the joint margin, the inflamed synovium (pannus) directly invades bone and cartilage to cause joint erosions. A key pathogenic factor in bone erosions and periarticular osteoporosis is osteoclast activation, stimulated by the production of M-CSF by synovial cells and RANKL by activated T cells (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0900" refid="f0175">Fig. 24.32</ce:cross-ref>). New blood-vessel formation (angiogenesis) occurs, causing the inflamed synovium to become highly vascular.

Erythema is unusual and its presence suggests coexistent sepsis. Characteristic deformities may develop with long-standing uncontrolled disease, although these have become less common over recent years with more aggressive management. They include ulnar deviation of the fingers, â€˜swan neckâ€™ deformity, the boutonniÃ¨re or â€˜button holeâ€™ deformity, and a Z deformity of the thumb (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0915" refid="f0180">Fig. 24.33</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0180"/>). Dorsal subluxation of the ulna at the distal radio-ulnar joint may occur and contribute to rupture of the fourth and fifth extensor tendons. Triggering of fingers may occur because of nodules in the flexor tendon sheaths. Subluxation of the MTP joints of the feet may result in â€˜cock-upâ€™ toe deformities, causing pain on weight-bearing on the exposed MTP heads and the development of secondary adventitious bursae and callosities. In the hindfoot, a valgus deformity of the calcaneus may be observed as the result of damage to the ankle and subtalar joints. This is often associated with loss of the longitudinal arch (flat foot) due to rupture of the tibialis posterior tendon. Popliteal (Baker's) cysts may occur in patients with knee synovitis, in which synovial fluid communicates with the cyst but is prevented from returning to the joint by a valve-like mechanism; this is not specific to RA. Rupture may be induced by knee flexion, leading to calf pain and swelling that may mimic a deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

The onset is often insidious, with subtle loss of function that may initially be attributed to active disease.

On first diagnosis, prednisolone should be started in a dose of 30â€¯mg daily gradually reducing in 5â€¯mg increments every 2â€¯weeks until therapy is withdrawn after about 12â€¯weeks. At the same time, methotrexate should be started in an initial dose of 15â€¯mg weekly, along with folic acid 5â€¯mg weekly, and escalated up to a maximum of 25â€¯mg weekly, depending on the response. If the patient fails to respond adequately or dose-limiting toxicity occurs, then an additional DMARD should be commenced in combination with MTX. The most common combination is triple therapy, in which methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are combined (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0970" refid="f0200">Fig. 24.37</ce:cross-ref>). Other DMARDs can be substituted or added, along with a low-dose glucocorticoid such as prednisolone (5â€“10â€¯mg daily) if the patient fails to respond fully. If disease activity remains high (DAS28 &#x003E;â€‰5.1) despite triple therapy, however, it is usual to progress to biologic therapy. The most commonly used first-line biologics in RA are TNF inhibitors, although several other options are available (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9255" refid="s0560">p. 1006</ce:cross-ref>). When the patient has been stabilised on biologic treatment for 12â€¯months or more, a reduction in dose should be considered, since it is possible to reduce the dose in up to 50% of patients without loss of therapeutic effect.

These lie within or close to genes in the IL-12, IL-23 and nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB) signalling pathways.

Patients with spondylitis should be prescribed the same exercise and posture regime as in axSpA/AS.

Other DMARDs may also be helpful, including sulfasalazine, ciclosporin and leflunomide. Particular attention should be paid to monitoring liver function in patients treated with DMARDs, since abnormalities are common in PsA. Hydroxychloroquine is generally avoided, as it can cause exfoliative skin reactions; it may, however, be tried in the small subset of patients who have mild PsA but no psoriasis and are ANA-positive. Anti-TNF treatment should be considered for individuals with active synovitis who respond inadequately to standard DMARDs, and treatment is effective for both PsA and psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, improves joint, dactylitis and enthesitis lesions in PsA.

These autoantibodies have specificity for a wide range of targets but many are directed against antigens present within the cell or within the nucleus. This has led to the hypothesis that SLE may occur because of defects in apoptosis or in the clearance of apoptotic cells, which causes inappropriate exposure of intracellular antigens on the cell surface, leading to polyclonal B- and T-cell activation and autoantibody production. This is supported by the fact that environmental factors that cause flares of lupus, such as ultraviolet light and infections, increase oxidative stress and cause cell damage.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies are positive in many, but not all, patients and are tested at the time of diagnosis by most laboratories using ELISA. ELISAs have low specificity, whereas testing for anti-dsDNA antibodies using <ce:italic>Crithidia luciliae</ce:italic> is highly specific.

The peak age of onset is in the fourth and fifth decades and overall prevalence is 10â€“20 per 100â€‰000, with a 4â€‰:â€‰1 female-to-male ratio. It is subdivided into diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSScl: 30% of cases) and limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSScl: 70% of cases). Some patients with lcSScl have calcinosis and telangiectasia. The prognosis in dcSScl is poor (5-year survival about 70%).

Isolated cases have been reported in which an SScl-like disease has been triggered by exposure to silica dust, vinyl chloride, epoxy resins and trichloroethylene. There is clear evidence of immunological dysfunction: T lymphocytes, especially those of the Th17 subtype, infiltrate the skin and there is abnormal fibroblast activation, leading to increased production of extracellular matrix in the dermis, primarily type I collagen. This results in symmetrical thickening, tightening and induration of the skin (scleroderma). Arterial and arteriolar narrowing occurs due to intimal proliferation and vessel wall inflammation. Endothelial injury causes release of vasoconstrictors and platelet activation, resulting in further ischaemia, which is thought to exacerbate the fibrotic process.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1425"><ce:section-title id="st1310">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s1430"><ce:section-title id="st1315">Skin</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p4920">Initially, there is non-pitting oedema of fingers and flexor tendon sheaths.

Rituximab appears to show efficacy in a majority of patients, although the only controlled study (which was criticised for its suboptimal design) was negative. In clinical practice, rituximab is an option for use with glucocorticoids, to maintain an early glucocorticoid-induced remission. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be effective in refractory cases. Mepacrine or hydroxychloroquine has been used for skin-predominant disease to some good effect in certain cases. One risk of treatment is glucocorticoid-induced myopathy. If the initial response to treatment is poor, further biopsy then shows type II fibre atrophy in glucocorticoid myopathy (compared with fibre necrosis and regeneration in active myositis).</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1515"><ce:section-title id="st1400">Juvenile dermatomyositis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5225">Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is by far the most common inflammatory myopathy in children and adolescents, and typically does not require a search for malignancy.

Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy may be present. Investigations typically provide evidence of an acute phase response, with a markedly elevated serum ferritin. Tests for RF and ANA are negative and so adult-onset Still's disease may be better classified as an autoinflammatory rather than an autoimmune disease.

The combined incidence is about 10â€“15/1â€‰000â€‰000. Two main subtypes are recognised. Microscopic polyangiitis is a necrotising small-vessel vasculitis found with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, often in association with alveolar haemorrhage. Cutaneous and gastrointestinal involvement is common and other features include neuropathy (15%) and pleural effusions (15%). Patients are usually myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody-positive. Secondly, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) is characterised by granuloma formation, mainly affecting the nasal passages, airways and kidney. A minority of patients present with glomerulonephritis. The most common presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is with epistaxis, nasal crusting and sinusitis, but haemoptysis and mucosal ulceration may also occur. Deafness may be a feature due to inner ear involvement, and proptosis may occur because of inflammation of the retro-orbital tissue (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1155" refid="f0275">Fig. 24.52</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0275"/>). This causes diplopia due to entrapment of the extra-ocular muscles, or loss of vision due to optic nerve compression. Disturbance of colour vision is an early feature of optic nerve compression. Untreated nasal disease ultimately leads to destruction of bone and cartilage. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates and nodules occur in 50% of patients (as seen on high-resolution CT of lungs).

In both conditions, the glucocorticoid dose should be progressively reduced, guided by symptoms and ESR, with the aim of reaching a dose of 10â€“15â€¯mg by about 8â€¯weeks. The rate of reduction should then be slowed by 1â€¯mg per month.

It has been estimated that more than 8.9â€¯million fractures occur annually worldwide and most of these occur in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. About one-third of all women and one-fifth of men aged 50 and above suffer fractures at some point in life. The burden of osteoporosis-related fractures is predicted to increase by two- to threefold by 2050 on a worldwide basis, due to ageing of the population. Osteoporosis is under-diagnosed and under-treated in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in rural areas, due to low provision of technologies like DXA, which are required to make the diagnosis. Fractures in patients with osteoporosis can affect any bone but common sites are the forearm (Collesâ€™ fracture), spine (vertebral fractures), humerus and hip. All of these fractures become more common with increasing age (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9010" refid="f0290">Fig. 24.55</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0290"/>). Since only about one-third of vertebral fractures come to medical attention (clinical vertebral fractures), the true number of patients with vertebral fracture is much greater than that shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf1190" refid="f0290">Figure 24.55</ce:cross-ref>.

The risk of fracture increases markedly with age in both genders (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1195" refid="f0290">Fig. 24.55</ce:cross-ref>). This is mostly attributable to an increased risk of falling with age (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0540" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00032-9#s0135">p. 1308</ce:intra-ref>) but is also due in part to an age-related decline in bone mass, especially in women (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1200" refid="f0300">Fig. 24.56</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0300"/>). Bone mass increases during growth to reach a peak between the ages of 20 and about 45â€¯years, but falls thereafter in both genders with an accelerated phase of bone loss after the menopause in women due to oestrogen deficiency. The loss of bone with ageing is caused by an imbalance in the bone remodelling cycle, whereby the amount of new bone formed by osteoblasts cannot keep pace with the amount that is removed by osteoclasts (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1205" refid="f0025">Fig. 24.2</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9300" refid="u0275">p. 985</ce:cross-ref>). The reduction in bone formation is thought to be partly due to differentiation of bone marrow stem cells to adipocytes, as opposed to osteoblasts. Osteoporosis sometimes occurs because of failure to attain adequate levels of peak bone mass but is more commonly due to age-related bone loss.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5560">Osteoporosis is a complex disease that can occur in association with a wide variety of risk factors, as summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf1210" refid="b0350">Box 24.69</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0350"/>. Genetic factors account for up to 80% of variation in bone density, and genome-wide association studies have shown that susceptibility is determined in part by a large number of common variants, some of which are involved in the RANK and Wnt signalling pathways (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1225" refid="f0030">Fig. 24.3</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9305" refid="s0045">p. 986</ce:cross-ref>). Rarely, osteoporosis may be caused by mutations in single genes. Environmental factors, such as exercise and calcium intake during growth and adolescence, are important in maximising peak bone mass and in regulating rates of post-menopausal bone loss. Smoking has a detrimental effect on BMD and is associated with an increased fracture risk, partly because female smokers have an earlier menopause than non-smokers.

Other contributory mechanisms include inhibition of intestinal calcium absorption, increased renal excretion of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism, which stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1640"><ce:section-title id="st1515">Pregnancy-associated osteoporosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p5760">This is a rare form of osteoporosis that typically presents with back pain and multiple vertebral fractures during the second or third trimester.

Non-vertebral fractures are almost always caused by a traumatic event, most usually a simple fall. The term â€˜fragility fractureâ€™ is used to describe a fracture that occurs as the result of a fall from standing height or less. These are typical of osteoporosis. It is important to remember that the majority of people who suffer a fragility fracture do not have osteoporosis; some have normal bone density but most have osteopenia (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1235" refid="f0305">Fig. 24.57</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0305"/> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf9310" refid="s0085">p. 988</ce:cross-ref>). The clinical signs of fracture are pain, local tenderness and deformity. In hip fracture, the patient is (with rare exceptions) unable to weight-bear and has a shortened and externally rotated limb on the affected side. The presentation of vertebral fractures is variable. Some patients present with acute severe back pain. This may radiate to the anterior chest or abdominal wall and be mistaken for a myocardial infarction, aortic dissection or intra-abdominal pathology (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0555" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00010-X#s0030">p. 176</ce:intra-ref>). In others the presentation is with height loss and kyphosis in the absence of pain or with chronic back pain.

These are a class of drugs with a central core of P-C-P atoms, to which various side-chains are attached. Following administration, they target bone surfaces and are ingested by osteoclasts during the process of bone resorption. The bisphosphonate is released within the osteoclasts and impairs bone resorption. This in turn causes an increase in bone density but this is principally due to increased mineralisation of bone, rather than an increase in bone mass (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1280" refid="f0315">Fig. 24.59</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0315"/>). Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture in patients with osteoporosis but do not completely prevent fractures occurring.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5850">Oral bisphosphonates are typically given for a period of 5â€¯years, at which point the need for continued therapy should be evaluated, with a repeat DXA if possible. If patients have remained free of fractures after 5â€¯years and if BMD levels have increased and no longer remain in the osteoporotic range, it is usual to instigate a 5-year spell off therapy. Treatment may be continued for up to 10â€¯years in patients whose BMD levels remain in the osteoporotic range after 5â€¯years. A change in treatment should be considered in patients who have lost BMD despite oral bisphosphonates (more than 4%). Most commonly, this will be a switch to parenteral zoledronic acid but teriparatide (TPTD) can also be considered in those with severe spinal osteoporosis. With intravenous zoledronic acid, 3â€¯years of therapy is equivalent to 6â€¯years in terms of fracture risk reduction and many experts recommend periods of 3â€¯years on and 3â€¯years off treatment to reduce the risk of over-suppression of bone turnover.</ce:para><ce:para id="p5855">Oral bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and should be taken on an empty stomach with plain water; no food should be eaten for 30â€“45â€¯minutes after administration. They are contraindicated in patients with oesophageal stricture or achalasia, since tablets may stick in the oesophagus, causing ulceration and perforation. Upper gastrointestinal upset occurs in about 5% of cases. Oral bisphosphonates can be used in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease but may cause worsening of symptoms. The most common adverse effect with intravenous bisphosphonates is a transient influenza-like illness typified by fever, malaise, anorexia and generalised aches, which occurs 24â€“48â€¯hours after administration. This is self-limiting but can be treated with paracetamol or NSAIDs if necessary. It predominantly occurs after the first exposure and tolerance develops thereafter.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw is characterised by the presence of necrotic bone in the mandible or maxilla, typically occurring after tooth extraction when the socket fails to heal. This complication is very rare in osteoporosis but patients receiving bisphosphonates should be advised to pay attention to good oral hygiene. There is no evidence that temporarily stopping bisphosphonates for tooth extraction alters the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Atypical subtrochanteric fractures have been described in patients who have received long-term bisphosphonates and appear to be the result of over-suppression of normal bone remodelling.

One potential adverse effect is hypocalcaemia but this can be mitigated by calcium and vitamin D supplements. Denosumab may rarely cause osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical subtrochanteric fractures.

It is given by a self-administered subcutaneous injection in a dose of 20â€¯Âµg daily for 2â€¯years. At the end of this period, bisphosphonate therapy or another inhibitor of bone resorption should be administered to maintain the increase in BMD. TPTD and oral bisphosphonates should not be given in combination, however, since the bisphosphonate blunts the anabolic effect. The efficacy of TPTD for prevention of non-vertebral fractures is similar to that of bisphosphonates but it is superior to oral bisphosphonates in preventing vertebral fractures. The most common adverse effects are headache, muscle cramps and dizziness. Mild hypercalcaemia may occur but it is usually asymptomatic and does not require discontinuation of treatment.

People with vitamin D levels in the range 25â€“50â€¯nmol/L (10â€“20â€¯ng/mL) are classified as having vitamin D insufficiency, whereas those with 25(OH)D levels above 50â€¯nmol/L (20â€¯ng/mL) are classified as having normal vitamin D status. In the elderly, a more appropriate normal threshold may be 75â€¯nmol/L (30â€¯ng/mL) or more, though there is some debate on the issue and evidence is not conclusive. The likelihood of developing vitamin D deficiency is strongly related to sunlight exposure. It is common in northern latitudes (or southern latitudes in the southern hemisphere) and shows seasonal variation. Vitamin D deficiency is also common in women who, for cultural reasons, cover their skin and face. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the winter and spring, and less common in summer and autumn (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1305" refid="f0320">Fig. 24.60</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0320"/>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s1740"><ce:section-title id="st1615">Pathogenesis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p6010">The source of vitamin D and pathways involved in regulating its metabolism are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf1310" refid="f0325">Figure 24.61</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0325"/>. In normal individuals, vitamin D (also known as cholecalciferol) comes from two sources: about 70% is made in the skin, where 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to cholecalciferol under the influence of ultraviolet light, whereas the remaining 30% is derived from the diet. The main dietary sources are oily fish and meat, although bread and dairy products are fortified with vitamin D in some countries. On entering the circulation, vitamin D is hydroxylated in the liver to form 25(OH) vitamin D and this is further hydroxylated in the kidney to form 1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D, the biologically active metabolite. The 1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D primarily acts on the gut to increase intestinal calcium absorption but also acts on the skeleton to stimulate bone remodelling. Synthesis of 1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D is regulated by a negative feedback loop orchestrated by the parathyroid glands. When vitamin D levels fall â€“ as the result of lower sunlight exposure or dietary lack â€“ production of 1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D is reduced, causing a reduction in calcium absorption from the gut. This causes a transient fall in serum calcium, which is detected by calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid chief cells; this increases PTH secretion, which restores calcium levels to normal. Vitamin D deficiency is, therefore, usually characterised by a low level of 25(OH)D and a raised level of PTH. Sometimes, low 25(OH)D levels may be observed in the presence of a normal PTH concentration. This is of uncertain clinical significance but might be due to variations in levels of vitamin D-binding protein. Serum concentrations of vitamin D are under genetic control and are associated with variants close to the <ce:italic>GC</ce:italic> gene, which encodes vitamin D-binding protein; the <ce:italic>DHCR7</ce:italic> gene, which encodes 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, responsible for catalysing conversion of 7-DHC to 25(OH)D; the <ce:italic>CYP2R1</ce:italic> gene, which encodes vitamin D-25-hydroxylase, responsible for hydroxylation of vitamin D in the liver; and the <ce:italic>CYP24A1</ce:italic> gene, which encodes vitamin D-24-hydroxylase, responsible for converting 25(OH)D to the inactive metabolite 24,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1745"><ce:section-title id="st1620">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p6015">Vitamin D deficiency does not cause symptoms and the diagnosis is made as the result of biochemical testing.

Production of FGF23 by osteocytes is under tonic inhibition by DMP1 and PHEX. In XLH, the inhibitory effect on FGF23 production is lost due to mutations in <ce:italic>PHEX</ce:italic> and a similar situation occurs in autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR1) due to loss-of-function mutations in <ce:italic>DMP1</ce:italic>. Mutations in the <ce:italic>ENPP1</ce:italic> gene, which encodes a phosphatase responsible for degradation of pyrophosphate, can also cause a recessive form of hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR2). In autosomal dominant hypophosphataemic rickets (ADHR), the FGF23 protein carries mutations that prevent FGF23 being degraded, thereby causing accumulation of intact FGF23 hormone in the circulation. In all three diseases, the elevation in FGF23 results in osteomalacia and rickets by causing phosphaturia by down-regulation of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters in the renal tubules, and also by inhibiting conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D by the kidney, which in turn causes reduced calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1820"><ce:section-title id="st1695">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p6090">The presentation is with symptoms and signs of rickets during childhood that do not respond to vitamin D supplementation.

Genetic factors are important and mutations in the <ce:italic>SQSTM1</ce:italic> gene are a common cause of classical PDB. The presence of nuclear inclusion bodies in osteoclasts has fuelled speculation that PDB might be caused by a slow virus infection but this is unproven. Biomechanical factors may influence which bones are affected, as PDB often starts at sites of muscle insertions into bone and, in some cases, localises to bones or limbs that have been subjected to repetitive trauma or overuse. Involvement of subchondral bone can compromise the joint and predispose to OA.

Many patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is frequently made on the basis of an X-ray or blood test performed for another reason. Clinical signs include bone deformity and expansion, and increased warmth over an affected bone. Neurological problems, such as deafness, cranial nerve defects, nerve root pain, spinal cord compression and spinal stenosis, may occur due to enlargement of affected bones and encroachment on the spinal cord and nerve foramina. Surprisingly, deafness seldom results from compression of the auditory nerve but is conductive, due to osteosclerosis of the temporal bone. The increased vascularity of Pagetic bone can rarely precipitate high-output cardiac failure in elderly patients with limited cardiac reserve.

Many patients have no family history. Some of these have new mutations whereas others may have recessive forms of the disease. The Sillence classification is commonly used to grade severity. This varies from neonatal lethal OI (type II), through very severe OI with multiple fractures in infancy and childhood (types III and IV), to mild (type I), in which affected patients typically have blue sclerae. The diagnosis of OI is usually obvious clinically, based on the presentation with multiple low-trauma fractures during infancy. The disease can be mistaken for non-accidental injury in childhood and for osteoporosis in adulthood; in such cases, genetic testing can be of diagnostic value. Treatment is multidisciplinary, involving surgical reduction and fixation of fractures and correction of limb deformities, and physiotherapy and occupational therapy for rehabilitation of patients with bone deformity.

Diabetic osteopathy presents as forefoot pain with radiographic progression from osteopenia to complete osteolysis of the phalanges and metatarsals. Diabetes also predisposes to osteoporosis, fragility fractures, adhesive capsulitis, Dupuytren's contracture, septic arthritis and Charcot's joints.</ce:para><ce:para id="p6285">Acromegaly (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0685" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#p5050">p. 685</ce:intra-ref>) can be associated with mechanical back pain, with normal or excessive movement; carpal tunnel syndrome; and Raynaud's syndrome and an arthropathy (50%). The arthropathy mainly affects the large joints and has clinical similarities to OA but with a normal or increased range of movement.

It typically presents between the ages of 40 and 50, and may predate other features of the disease. The small joints of the hands and wrists are typically affected but the hips, shoulders and knees may also be involved. The X-ray changes resemble OA but cysts are often multiple and prominent, with little osteophyte formation. Involvement of the radiocarpal and MCP joints may occur, which is unusual in primary OA, and about 30% have calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease and/or pseudogout.

The patient is unable to extend the fingers fully and there is puckering of the skin with palpable nodules. The ring and little fingers are usually the first and worst affected. Dupuytren's contracture is usually painless but causes problems due to limitation of hand function and snagging of the curled fingers in pockets. It is age-related, usually bilateral and more common in men. There is a strong genetic component and sometimes may be familial, with dominant inheritance. The condition can be associated with plantar fibromatosis, Peyronie's disease, alcohol misuse and chronic vibration injury. It is very slowly progressive.

Inclusion body myositis typically presents with distal muscle weakness. In time, muscles atrophy. Investigation is the same as for polymyositis (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9360" refid="p5195">p. 1039</ce:cross-ref>). There is typically a slightly elevated creatine kinase and myopathic changes on EMG.

It typically presents during childhood or adolescence but usually persists into adulthood, when it can be associated with back pain, deformity and secondary OA. In about 20% of cases, scoliosis is secondary to a neuromuscular disorder, such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy or neurofibromatosis. It may also occur in association with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan's syndrome. The term idiopathic scoliosis is used to described the remaining cases where there is no obvious cause. In fact, there is strong evidence from twin studies that idiopathic scoliosis is genetically mediated. The diagnosis can usually be made clinically by physical examination, which shows the characteristic spinal deformity. Spinal X-rays can be used to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity. External bracing and/or surgical intervention are often performed in adolescents with severe deformities to correct deformity or prevent progression but the evidence base is poor. In adulthood, treatment is symptomatic in nature with analgesics, NSAID or antineuropathic medications.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s2035"><ce:section-title id="st1890">Spondylolysis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p6380">Spondylolysis describes a break in the integrity of the neural arch. The principal cause is an acquired defect in the pars interarticularis due to a fracture, mainly seen in gymnasts, dancers and runners, in whom it is an important cause of back pain. Spondylolisthesis describes the condition in which a defect causes slippage of a vertebra on the one below. This may be congenital, post-traumatic or degenerative. Rarely, it can result from metastatic destruction of the posterior elements. Uncomplicated spondylolysis does not cause symptoms but spondylolisthesis can lead to low back pain aggravated by standing and walking. Occasionally, symptoms of nerve root or spinal compression may occur. The diagnosis can be made on lateral X-rays of the lumbar spine but MRI may be required if there is neurological involvement. Advice on posture and muscle-strengthening exercises is required in mild cases. Surgical fusion is indicated for severe and recurrent low back pain. Surgical decompression is mandatory prior to fusion in patients with significant lumbar stenosis or symptoms of cauda equina compression.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s2040"><ce:section-title id="st1895">Synovitisâ€“acneâ€“pustulosisâ€“hyperostosisâ€“osteitis syndrome</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p6385">The synovitisâ€“acneâ€“pustulosisâ€“hyperostosisâ€“osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is a disorder characterised by bone pain and swelling due to a sterile osteomyelitis and hyperostosis predominantly targeting the clavicles and bones of the anterior chest wall.

Other features include a pustulotic rash affecting the palms and soles of the feet, sacroiliitis and synovitis of peripheral joints. It most commonly presents in children and young or middle-aged adults. Various treatments have been used, including glucocorticoids, DMARDs, bisphosphonates, anakinra and TNF blockers, with most success arising from biologic use.
