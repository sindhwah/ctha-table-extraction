as ‘mental’ rather than as ‘physical’ illnesses. This is because they manifest with disordered functioning in the areas of emotion, perception, thinking and memory, and formerly had no clearly biological basis. However, as biochemical and structural abnormalities of the brain are identified in an increasing number of psychiatric disorders, and psychological and behavioural factors are identified in many medical illnesses, the distinction between mental and physical illness has become questionable.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0225">The World Health Organisation (WHO) periodically publishes its International Classification of Disease (ICD), which provides definitions for every recognised clinical condition. The current edition (ICD-10) comprises 22 chapters. The diagnoses listed in Chapter V, ‘Mental and behavioural disorders’ (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0220" refid="b0010">Box 28.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>), are used by psychiatrists around the world in everyday clinical practice and it is these conditions that provide the focus for this chapter.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0235">Psychiatric disorders are among the most common of all human illnesses. The WHO's Global Burden of Disease study found ‘Mental, neurological and substance misuse disorders’ to be the leading cause of ‘Years lost to disability’ (YLDs), accounting for 28.5% of global YLDs. As with most clinical conditions, the prevalence of mental disorders varies with the setting.

However, while some disorders, such as Huntington's disease, are due to mutations in a single gene, the genetic contribution to most psychiatric disorders is polygenic in nature and mediated by the combined effects of several genetic variants, each with modest effects and modulated by environmental factors.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0140"><ce:section-title id="st0130">Brain structure and function</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0455">Brain structure is grossly normal in most psychiatric disorders, although abnormalities may be observed in some conditions, such as generalised atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and enlarged ventricles with a slight decrease in brain size in schizophrenia. The functioning of the brain, however, is commonly altered due to changes in neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Functional differences in specific areas of the brain are increasingly being recognised using advanced imaging techniques. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) studies of dopamine ligand binding in schizophrenia has consistently demonstrated increased dopamine synthesis in the striatum, even in untreated patients, while a smaller body of PET evidence points towards reductions in 5-HT transporter binding in the mid-brain and amygdala in depression.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0460">Pattern classification approaches to structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data can accurately predict the development of schizophrenia in at-risk populations, and generalised grey matter loss over time is a poor prognostic guide. Increased anterior cingulate activity in depression is a consistent predictor of good response to both antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy. While these and other imaging techniques show potential as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aids, they remain research tools at the present time.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0465">It is also increasingly clear that psychiatric disorders are associated with disruptions in neuronal systems rather than single sites. These can be characterised using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white-matter projection fibres and resting-state/task-based functional MRI (fMRI) studies of inter-regional connectivity. For example, DTI has shown reduced white-matter density in limbic (‘emotional’) system tracts, such as the fornix and cingulum, in many disorders. Resting-state fMRI studies consistently identify ‘default mode’, salience and executive control networks of interconnected neuronal populations for certain mental activities.

Those occurring when falling asleep (‘hypnagogic’) and on waking (‘hypnopompic’) are a normal phenomenon and not pathological.

While this potentially raises legal issues, in most countries, including the UK, common law confers on doctors the right, and indeed the duty, to intervene against a patient's wishes if this is necessary. Sedation may be required and can be achieved with antipsychotic drugs (such as haloperidol) and/or benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam or diazepam). The choice of drug, dose, route and rate of administration depends on the patient's age, gender and physical health, as well as the likely cause of the disturbed behaviour. The benefits of sedation must always be balanced against the potential risks. When prescribing benzodiazepines, consider the risk of respiratory depression (particularly in patients with lung disease) and encephalopathy (in those with liver disease). When prescribing antipsychotic drugs for acute sedation, consider the risk of acute dystonias (such as ‘oculogyric crisis’) and acute arrhythmias (in patients with heart disease). Thus for a frail elderly woman with emphysema and delirium, sedation may be achieved with a low dose (0.5 mg) of oral haloperidol, while for a strong young man with an acute psychotic episode, 10 mg or more of intravenous diazepam and a similar dose of haloperidol may be required. A parenterally administered anticholinergic agent, such as procyclidine, should be available to treat extrapyramidal effects from haloperidol if they arise.

It is important to exclude a focal brain lesion. This is done by determining that there is cognitive disturbance in more than one area. Mental state assessment is important to seek evidence of depression, which may coexist with or occasionally cause apparent cognitive impairment. Many of the primary degenerative diseases that cause dementia have characteristic features that may allow a specific diagnosis during life. Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, for example, is usually quickly progressive (over months) and is associated with myoclonus. The more slowly progressive dementias are more difficult to distinguish during life, but fronto-temporal dementia typically presents with signs of temporal or frontal lobe dysfunction, whereas Lewy body dementia may present with visual hallucinations. The course may also help to distinguish types of dementia. Gradual worsening suggests Alzheimer's disease, whereas stepwise deterioration is typical of vascular dementia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0525"><ce:section-title id="st0460">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1615">The aim is to seek treatable causes and to estimate prognosis.

Imaging of the brain can exclude potentially treatable structural lesions, such as hydrocephalus, cerebral tumour or chronic subdural haematoma, though the only abnormality usually seen is that of generalised atrophy. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful if Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is suspected, as characteristic abnormalities of generalised periodic sharp wave pattern are usually observed.

Psychotropic drugs may have a role in alleviating symptoms, such as disturbance of sleep, perception or mood, but should be used with care because of an increased mortality in patients who have been treated long-term with these agents. Sedation is not a substitute for good care of patients and carers or, in the later stages, attentive residential nursing care. In the UK, incapacity and mental health legislation may be required to manage patients' financial and domestic affairs, as well as to determine their safe placement.

These cases fall into two main groups: early-onset disease with autosomal dominant inheritance and a later-onset group where the inheritance is polygenic. Mutations in several genes have been described but most are rare and/or of small effect. The inheritance of one of the alleles of apolipoprotein ε (apo ε4) is associated with an increased risk of developing the disease (2–4 times higher in heterozygotes and 6–8 times higher in homozygotes). Its presence is, however, neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of the disease and so genetic testing for ApoE4 is not clinically useful. The brain in Alzheimer's disease is macroscopically atrophic, particularly the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Histologically, the disease is characterised by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. Histochemical staining demonstrates significant quantities of amyloid in the plaques (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0375" refid="f0030">Fig. 28.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>); these typically stain positive for the protein ubiquitin, which normally is involved in targeting unwanted or damaged proteins for degradation. This has led to the suggestion that the disease may be due to defects in the ability of neuronal cells to degrade unwanted proteins. Many different neurotransmitter abnormalities have also been described. In particular, there is impairment of cholinergic transmission, although abnormalities of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), 5-HT, glutamate and substance P have also been described.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0555"><ce:section-title id="st0490">Clinical features</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1720">The key clinical feature is impairment of the ability to remember new information. Hence, patients present with gradual impairment of memory, usually in association with disorders of other cortical functions. Short- and long-term memory are both affected but defects in the former are usually more obvious. Later in the course of the disease, typical features include apraxia, visuo-spatial impairment and aphasia. In the early stages of the disease, patients may notice these problems, but as the disease progresses it is common for patients to deny that there is anything wrong (anosognosia). In this situation, patients are often brought to medical attention by their carers. Depression is commonly present. Occasionally, patients become aggressive, and the clinical features can be made acutely worse by intercurrent physical disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1725">Patients typically present with subjective memory loss, sometimes getting lost in familiar locations.

Novel treatments are under development to block amyloid plaque formation directly, by inhibiting the enzyme γ-secretase. Non-pharmacological approaches include the provision of a familiar environment for the patient and support for the carers.

Symptoms usually occur before the age of 60 and the prevalence has been estimated at 15 per 100 000 in the population aged between 45 and 65 years. The three major clinical subtypes are behavioural-variant fronto-temporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia. Pick's disease is a common cause of the first two in particular. Genetic factors play an important role and familial cases have been described caused by mutations in several genes, including <ce:italic>MAPT</ce:italic>, which encodes microtubule-associated protein tau, <ce:italic>GRN</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>TPD43</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>FUS</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>VCP</ce:italic> and <ce:italic>C9orf72</ce:italic>.

It is of interest that many of the gene mutations that cause fronto-temporal dementia are also associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0180" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s1235">p. 1116</ce:intra-ref>), suggesting that these disorders share a similar pathogenic basis in which neuronal degeneration is caused by accumulation of abnormal proteins. The clinical presentation may be with personality change due to frontal lobe involvement or with language disturbance due to temporal lobe involvement. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, memory is relatively preserved in the early stages. There is no specific treatment. Disinhibition and compulsive behaviours can be helped by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Although Alzheimer's and fronto-temporal dementia share certain symptoms, they cannot be treated with the same pharmacological agents because the cholinergic systems are not affected in the latter.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0575"><ce:section-title id="st0510">Lewy body dementia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1745">This neurodegenerative disorder is clinically characterised by dementia and signs of Parkinson's disease.

It blocks the metabolism of alcohol, causing acetaldehyde to accumulate. When alcohol is consumed, an unpleasant reaction follows, with headache, flushing and nausea. Disulfiram is always an adjunct to other treatments, especially supportive psychotherapy. Treatment with antidepressants may be required if depression is severe or does not resolve with abstinence.

Diagnosis requires a longitudinal perspective, with clear evidence that the patient's behavioural traits and pattern of interaction with the world have been present throughout their adult life, have been evident across a range of settings and have caused repeated and persistent problems. It can be difficult to achieve this during a single interview, and most psychiatrists warn against making a diagnosis of personality disorder until the patient has been seen several times and corroborative accounts have been obtained.

Unlike depression arising at other times, post-partum depression is not more common in lower socioeconomic groups; the prevalence is similar across all social backgrounds. Diagnosis, explanation and reassurance are important. The usual psychological and drug treatments for depression should be considered (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9125" refid="s0820">p. 1199</ce:cross-ref>) to minimise the impact on the mother and child at what is a very important time for both.

It usually takes the form of a manic or depressive psychosis but with sudden onset and fluctuation in severity. Delirium is rare with modern obstetric management but should still be considered in the differential diagnosis. Suspiciousness, concealment and impulsivity are common features of puerperal psychosis; hence the risks to both mother and baby are considerable. The clinical priority is to ensure the safety of both mother and baby and so psychiatric admission, ideally to a psychiatric mother and baby unit, is usually necessary. Pharmacological treatment reflects the clinical picture; antipsychotic medication is almost always indicated, augmented by antidepressants if the picture is of psychotic depression and/or by mood stabilisers if the picture is bipolar. Most women recover but the risk of recurrence following subsequent deliveries is 50% and some women will progress to psychotic episodes not associated with childbirth, usually bipolar disorder.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1305"><ce:section-title id="st1195">Psychiatric disorders during pregnancy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3020">Pregnancy can affect the course of psychiatric illnesses and of bipolar affective disorder in particular.

Most guidelines recommend deferring conception until mood-stabilising medication is not required, or replacing the mood stabiliser with an antipsychotic such as chlorpromazine. Furthermore, the immediate post-partum period is associated with a dramatically increased risk of relapse in bipolar disorder: studies report relapse rates of up to 60% in the first 3 months after delivery in the absence of prophylactic medication. When relapse occurs following childbirth, not only are the stakes higher than at other times but also the onset of illness is more rapid, the symptoms more severe and concealment more pronounced. Post-partum relapse of bipolar affective disorder requires urgent specialist treatment, usually comprising admission to a psychiatric mother and baby unit. Ideally, women with major mental disorders such as bipolar affective disorder should be offered expert pre-conception advice to help them make informed decisions about medication and other aspects of their psychiatric care.

Psychiatry is similar to other branches of medicine in the applicability of common and case law but differs in that patients with psychiatric disorders can also be subject to legislative requirements to remain in hospital or to undergo treatments they refuse, such as the administration of antipsychotic drugs to a patient with acute schizophrenia who lacks insight and whose symptoms and/or behaviour pose a risk to himself/herself or to others.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3030">The UK has three different Mental Health Acts, covering England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and all of these have recently been revised. Other countries may have very different provisions. It is important for practitioners to be familiar with the relevant provisions that apply in their jurisdictions and are likely to arise in the clinical settings in which they work.</ce:para><ce:para id="p3035">All the countries that make up the UK have also introduced Incapacity Acts in recent years, with detailed provisions covering medical treatments for patients incapable of consenting, whether this incapacity arises from physical or mental illness. In general, the guiding principle in British law is that people should be free to make their own decision about any proposed medical treatment, except where their ability to make and/or communicate that decision is demonstrably impaired (by mental illness or physical incapacity). Any restrictions or compulsions applied should be the minimum necessary, they should be applied only for as long as is necessary, and there should be a benefit to the patient that balances the restrictions imposed. There should also be provisions for appeals and oversight.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st1205">Further
