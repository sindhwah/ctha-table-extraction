The outer layer is the epidermis, a stratified squamous epithelium consisting mainly of keratinocytes. The epidermis is attached to, but separated from, the underlying dermis by the basement membrane. The dermis is less cellular and supports blood vessels, nerves and epidermal-derived appendages (hair follicles and sweat glands). Below it is the subcutis, consisting of adipose tissue.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Epidermis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0280">In most sites, the epidermis is only 0.1–0.2 mm thick, except on the palms or soles, where it can extend to several millimetres. Keratinocytes make up approximately 90% of epidermal cells (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0260" refid="f0020">Fig. 29.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>). The main proliferative compartment is the basal layer. Keratinocytes synthesise a range of structural proteins, such as keratins, loricrin and filaggrin (filament aggregating protein), which play key roles in maintaining the skin's barrier function. Keratinocytes are also responsible for synthesis of vitamin D under the influence of ultraviolet B (UVB) light (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#s9005">p. 1049</ce:intra-ref>). There are more than 50 types of keratin and their expression varies by body site, site within the epidermis and disease state. Mutations of certain keratin genes can result in blistering disorders (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9105" refid="s1335">p. 1254</ce:cross-ref>) and ichthyosis (characterised by scale without major inflammation). As keratinocytes migrate from the basal layer, they differentiate, producing a variety of protein and lipid products. Keratinocytes undergo apoptosis in the granular layer before losing their nuclei and becoming the flattened corneocytes of the stratum corneum (keratin layer). The epidermis is a site of lipid production, and the ability of the stratum corneum to act as a hydrophobic barrier is the result of its ‘bricks and mortar’ design; dead corneocytes with highly cross-linked protein membranes (‘bricks’) lie within a metabolically active lipid layer synthesised by keratinocytes (‘mortar’). Terminal differentiation of keratinocytes relies on the keratin filaments being aggregated and this is, in part, mediated by filaggrin. Mutations of the filaggrin gene are found in icthyosis vulgaris and in some patients with atopic eczema (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9110" refid="s1040">p. 1245</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0285">The skin is a barrier against physical stresses.

The cell membrane of the epidermal basal cell is attached to the basement membrane via hemi-desmosomes. The lamina lucida lies immediately below the basal cell membrane and is composed predominantly of laminin. Anchoring filaments extend through the lamina lucida to attach to the lamina densa.

Fibroblasts are the predominant cells but others include mast cells, mononuclear phagocytes, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, neurons and endothelial cells. The acellular part of the dermis consists mainly of collagen I and III, elastin and reticulin, synthesised by fibroblasts. Support is provided by an amorphous ground substance (mostly glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulphate), whose production and catabolism are altered by hormonal changes and ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Based on the pattern of collagen fibrils, the superficial dermis is termed the ‘papillary dermis’, and the deeper, coarser part is the ‘reticular dermis’.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Epidermal appendages</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Hair follicles</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0320">There are 3–5 million hair follicles, epidermal invaginations that develop during the second trimester.

Capillary loops arise from terminal arterioles in the horizontal papillary plexus. Blood vessels are supplied by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, with the relative contributions of the pathways differing by site.

In the most common scenario, a skin biopsy is undertaken in order to obtain tissue on which to perform standard histopathology. However, tissue may also be subjected to a variety of staining and culture techniques, including immunostaining. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies is especially useful for tumour diagnosis. When a dermatologist or pathologist with dermatopathology expertise is involved, it can also assist in the diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases. It is rare for histopathology of a previously undiagnosed inflammatory skin disease to provide a diagnosis on its own; clinico-pathological correlation is critical. Most biopsies are stained with haematoxylin and eosin but other stains may be useful in special situations, such as for fungal hyphae, iron or mucin. Direct immunofluorescence can also be undertaken on a fresh skin biopsy, allowing antigen visualisation using fluorescein-labelled antibodies; this is especially important in the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous disorders or connective tissue disease, such as cutaneous lupus.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0105"><ce:section-title id="st0095">Microbiology</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0110"><ce:section-title id="st0100">Bacteriology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0415">Bacterial swabs may identify a causative infective agent.

The mainstay investigation is monochromator phototesting, which involves exposing the patient's back to increasing doses of irradiation using narrow wavebands across the solar spectrum and then assessing responses, using the minimal erythema dose (MED) at each waveband. This is the dose required to cause just perceptible skin reddening and is compared with values for the normal population. If a patient has reduced MED (develops erythema at lower doses than healthy subjects), this indicates abnormal photosensitivity. Thus, monochromator phototesting can be used to determine whether a patient is abnormally photosensitive, which wavebands are involved and how sensitive the patient is (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9130" refid="s0235">p. 1220</ce:cross-ref>). Provocation testing can be performed with a broadband (usually UVA) source to induce rash at a test site (most useful for polymorphic light eruption) and can be helpful for diagnosis.

The terms ‘itch’ and ‘pruritus’ are synonymous; however, ‘pruritus’ is often used when itch is generalised. Itch can arise from primary cutaneous disease or be secondary to systemic disease, which may cause itch by central or peripheral mechanisms. Even when the mechanism is peripheral, there are not always signs of primary skin disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0675">The nerve endings that signal itch are in the epidermis or near the dermo-epidermal junction. The underlying mechanisms of itch are not fully understood. Transmission is by unmyelinated slow-conducting C fibres through the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and then the cortex. Aδ fibres also seem to be involved in transmitting signals to the spinal cord, and the heat-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels 1–4 are important. There is an inhibitory relationship between pain and itch. Scratching may relieve the symptom of itch after the sensation has ceased and this is either by stimulation of ascending sensory pathways that inhibit itch-transmitting neurons at the spinal cord (Wall's ‘gate’ mechanism), or by direct damage to cutaneous sensory nerves.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0680">The mechanisms of itch in most systemic diseases remain unclear. The itch of kidney disease, for example, may be mediated by circulating endogenous opioids.

This requires a thorough history and examination, sometimes with investigations, to exclude systemic disease. Many common primary skin disorders are associated with itch (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0400" refid="b0035">Box 29.6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0035"/>). If itch is not connected with primary skin disease, other causes should be considered (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0405" refid="b0040">Box 29.7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>). These include liver diseases (mainly cholestatic diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis), malignancies (generalised itch may be the presenting feature of lymphoma), haematological conditions (generalised itch in chronic iron deficiency or water contact-provoked (aquagenic) intense itch in polycythaemia), endocrine diseases (including hypo- and hyperthyroidism), chronic kidney disease (in which severity of itch is not always clearly associated with plasma creatinine concentration) and psychogenic causes (such as in ‘delusions of infestation’). Itch is common in pregnancy and may be due to one of the pregnancy-specific dermatoses. Making a correct diagnosis is particularly important in pregnancy, as some disorders can be associated with increased fetal risk (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0410" refid="b0045">Box 29.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0045"/>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0235"><ce:section-title id="st0205">Investigations and management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0760">Investigations should be directed towards finding an underlying cause and there will be a different approach for itch with rash, as opposed to itch with no signs of primary skin disease (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0415" refid="f0035">Fig. 29.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0035"/>). If there are no signs of primary skin disease, investigations should be undertaken to exclude systemic disease or iatrogenic causes. Psychogenic itch should be considered only if organic disease has been ruled out. There are no consistently effective therapies to suppress itch, and so establishing the underlying cause is critical. If a clear-cut diagnosis cannot be made, non-specific approaches can be used for symptom relief. These include sedation, often with H<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> receptor antihistamines, along with emollients and counter-irritants (such as topical menthol-containing preparations). UVB phototherapy is useful for generalised itch due to a variety of causes but the only randomised controlled study of efficacy is in chronic kidney disease. Other treatments include low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (probably through similar mechanisms to those involved when these drugs are used for chronic pain) and opiate antagonists. If a psychogenic itch is considered likely, antidepressants and/or cognitive behavioural therapy may be effective. Itch of any cause can be severe and its potentially major adverse effects on quality of life are not always fully appreciated.

Chronic UVR exposure increases skin cancer risk and photo-ageing (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9215" refid="s0105">p. 1215</ce:cross-ref>).

These patients commonly experience perennial symptoms and may not be aware of the association with daylight exposure. Other photosensitive conditions, such as actinic prurigo or chronic actinic dermatitis, may also involve covered sites. Sparing of habitually exposed sites, such as the face and back of hands, occurs most commonly in polymorphic light eruption (PLE) and is called the ‘hardening phenomenon’.

Counselling in regard to sun avoidance is essential: keeping out of direct sun in the middle of the day, covering up with clothing, wearing hats with a wide brim and careful use of high-factor sunscreens. Paradoxically, in some conditions, particularly PLE and solar urticaria, phototherapy can be used to induce ‘hardening’; the mechanism of desensitisation is uncertain. Other approaches may be necessary, depending on disease and severity, and may include antihistamines (useful in two-thirds of patients with solar urticaria) and systemic immunosuppression (sometimes required in the immunological photodermatoses). Patients with photosensitivity are at risk of vitamin D deficiency because of reduced synthesis in the skin and should be advised to optimise dietary vitamin D intake or take supplements (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0240" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#s1770">p. 1052</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s0260"><ce:section-title id="st0225">Sunscreens</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0825">Sunscreens can be divided into two categories: chemical sunscreens, which absorb specific wavelengths of UVR, and physical sunscreens, which reflect UVR and the shorter visible wavelengths (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0445" refid="f0045">Fig. 29.6</ce:cross-ref>). Sunscreens are now highly sophisticated and most offer protection against UVB and most UVA wavelengths. If a patient is abnormally photosensitive to the longer wavelengths of UVA and the visible part of the spectrum (for example, in cutaneous porphyrias and solar urticaria), then conventional sunscreens are not beneficial and specific reflectant sunscreens are required. Historically, these agents were less cosmetically acceptable due to visible light reflection, but current formulations, some of which are tinted, have reduced this problem.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0830">Sunscreen protection levels are described by sun protection factor (SPF). This is the ratio of the dose of UVR required to produce skin erythema in the presence and absence of the sunscreen. A sunscreen of SPF20 means that it would take 20 times as long for a person to develop sunburn in the presence of the sunscreen, as compared to not using it. Therefore, SPF is really a sunburn protection factor and is not a good guide to how well a sunscreen will perform in protecting against other reactions (such as skin pain in erythropoietic protoporphyria or UVR-induced immunosuppression). SPF values are determined under experimental conditions whereas, in practice, people tend to use 25–33% of the amount of sunscreen required to achieve the stated SPF. Patient counselling is therefore important with regard to adequate application of sunscreen.

Oedema must be reduced by leg elevation and, if there is no arterial compromise, graduated compression bandaging from toes to knees to enhance venous return and improve healing. Compression bandaging is effective for individuals with an ABPI of more than 0.8 but should be avoided if the ABPI is less than 0.8.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1015">If the ulcer is purulent, weak potassium permanganate soaks may help, and exudate and slough can be removed with normal saline or clean water.

A variety of dressings may be used, including non-adherent and absorbent (alginates, hydrogels, hydrocolloids) types. The frequency of dressing changes varies; heavily exudative ulcers may need daily dressings, whereas changes once weekly may suffice for drier ulcers.

Systemic antibiotics are indicated only if there is evidence of infection, as opposed to colonisation. Various techniques of split-thickness grafting (such as pinch and mince grafts) may hasten healing of clean ulcers but do not reduce recurrence risk. Leg ulcers can be very persistent.

Insensible fluid loss can be many litres above normal losses. Protein may be lost directly from the skin and through the gut because of the protein-losing enteropathy that often accompanies conditions such as erythrodermic psoriasis. To reduce the risks of infection, any intravenous cannulae should be sited in peripheral veins, if possible. In the initial management of acute erythroderma, urinary catheterisation is often required (for patient comfort and accurate fluid balance monitoring) but catheters should be removed as soon as possible.

The psychological impact of chronic skin diseases should not be under-estimated and it is important to remember that psychiatric illness can also manifest as a skin disease, such as in delusions of infestation or trichotillomania. Careful clinical assessment, taking psychological factors into account, is essential and any management strategy must include approaches to address the psychological well-being of the patient.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0350"><ce:section-title id="st0305">Topical treatments</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1060">Topical treatments are first-line therapy for most skin diseases and many can be treated effectively by topical therapies alone. Selection of the appropriate active drug/ingredient and vehicle is essential. Ointments are preferred to creams for dry skin conditions, such as chronic eczemas, as they are more hydrating and contain fewer preservatives than creams, and so allergy risk is reduced. However, patients find creams easier to apply and so adherence may be better. Gels and lotions can be easier to use on hair-bearing sites. The molecular weight and lipid–water coefficient of a drug determine its skin penetration, with larger, water-soluble, polar molecules penetrating poorly. In skin disease, if the stratum corneum is impaired – as in eczema – increased drug absorption occurs. Occlusion under dressings also increases absorption. Drugs can be used in different potencies or concentrations, or in combination with other active ingredients, and many are available in more than one formulation. The properties of different vehicles are listed in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0480" refid="b0060">Box 29.11</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0060"/>. Overall, adherence to topical treatments can be problematic, so it is essential for patients to know exactly what is required of them and for regimens to be kept as simple as possible.

Selection of the correct product depends on the condition being treated, body site and duration of expected use. Mild topical glucocorticoids are used in delicate areas, such as the face or genitals, and close supervision of glucocorticoid use at these sites is required. In contrast, very potent glucocorticoids may be required under occlusion for chronic resistant disease such as nodular prurigo.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1155">Adverse cutaneous effects of chronic glucocorticoid use include atrophy (<ce:bold>definition</ce:bold>: an area of thin, translucent skin caused by loss of epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous fat – <ce:cross-ref id="crf0495" refid="f0065">Fig. 29.10</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0065"/>), striae (<ce:bold>definition</ce:bold>: linear, atrophic, pink, purple or white bands caused by connective tissue changes – <ce:cross-ref id="crf0500" refid="f0065">Fig. 29.10</ce:cross-ref>), petechiae and purpura (<ce:bold>definition</ce:bold>: haemorrhagic macules or papules caused by extravasated blood – see <ce:cross-ref id="crf9270" refid="f0015">p. 1211</ce:cross-ref>) and telangiectasiae (<ce:bold>definition</ce:bold>: visible dilatations of small cutaneous blood vessels – see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0505" refid="f0070">Fig. 29.11A</ce:cross-ref>), increased risk of infection and systemic absorption, causing Cushingoid features and suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. However, under-treatment with glucocorticoids is more common than over-treatment in routine clinical practice. In general, the lowest potency of glucocorticoid should be used for the shortest period to gain control of the disease; this can be achieved by initial use of a more potent glucocorticoid, with reduction in potency or frequency of application as control is gained. Tolerance or tachyphylaxis can develop with chronic use, so intermittent courses of treatment are advised. Caution is required with glucocorticoids in psoriasis, as rebound, unstable or pustular psoriasis can occur with sudden cessation of use. Nevertheless, glucocorticoids are invaluable for many sites, particularly the flexures. Topical glucocorticoids are often formulated in combination with antiseptics, antibiotics or antifungals, and their controlled use may be appropriate in infected eczema or flexural psoriasis.

It is subdivided into non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. NMSC is further subdivided into the most common skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The latter has precursor non-invasive states of intra-epithelial carcinoma (Bowen's disease, BD) and dysplasia (actinic keratosis, AK). Melanoma is much less common than NMSC, but because of its metastatic risk it is the cause of most skin cancer deaths.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1320">UVR is a complete carcinogen and is the main environmental risk factor for skin cancer, which is much more common in countries with high ambient sun exposure, such as Australia. Skin cancer risk also increases if an individual migrates to such a country when young, particularly if less than 10 years of age. Epidemiological evidence supports a close link between chronic UVR exposure and risk of SCC and AK, and a modest link between sun exposure and BCC risk. Melanoma usually arises on sites that are intermittently exposed to UVR, and episodes of sunburn have been implicated as a risk factor for melanoma. There is good evidence to show that sunbed exposure is also a risk for both melanoma and NMSC, particularly when exposure starts in adolescence and early adult life. Strategies to reduce sun exposure are therefore important for skin cancer prevention, with reliance mainly on behavioural modification, covering up and judicious sunscreen use. Indeed, there is evidence to show that sunscreen use reduces naevi development in children, and in adults regular sunscreen use reduces the risk of AK and SCC and is likely also to have preventative roles in melanoma and BCC development.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1325">There are identifiable genetic predispositions for some skin cancers, such as in xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive condition caused by an inherited defect in DNA excision repair (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9325" refid="s0250">pp. 1221</ce:cross-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii0405" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00033-0#s0115">1321</ce:intra-ref>), or basal cell naevus (Gorlin's) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations affecting the <ce:italic>PTCH1</ce:italic> tumour suppressor genes, with consequent activation of the Hedgehog pathway (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0410" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00033-0#s0115">p. 1321</ce:intra-ref>).

In Europe, the ratio of BCC to SCC is 4–5 : 1 in immunocompetent patients. It is a malignant tumour that rarely metastasises; it is thought to derive from immature pluripotent epidermal cells and is composed of cells with similarities to basal layer epidermis and appendages. Lesions typically occur at sites of moderate sun exposure, particularly the face, and are slow-growing. The incidence increases with age and males are more commonly affected.

There may be some pigmentation or a cystic component. A superficial multifocal type can occur, frequently on the trunk, and may be large (up to 10 cm in diameter); often there are multiple lesions. Superficial BCC usually presents as a red/brown plaque or patch with a raised, thread-like edge, which is often best seen by stretching the skin; this helps to distinguish it from Bowen's disease. Less commonly, a morphoeic, infiltrative BCC presents as a poorly defined, slowly enlarging, sclerotic yellow/grey plaque.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0525"><ce:section-title id="st0470">Diagnosis and management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1350">The diagnosis is often obvious clinically, based on the features mentioned above, although a diagnostic confirmatory biopsy may be required prior to definitive treatment. Management depends on the characteristics of the tumour and on patient factors, including comorbidities and patient wishes. Essentially, treatment will be either surgical or, in some cases, medical (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0525" refid="b0075">Box 29.14</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0075"/>). Surgical excision, ideally with a 4–5 mm margin, is the treatment of choice, with a cure rate of approximately 95%. Curettage and cautery may also be effective for selected lesions. Management of infiltrative morphoeic BCC and/or lesions at difficult sites, such as around the eye, may require more complex techniques such as Mohs' micrographic surgery to ensure adequate tumour excision margins, while conserving unaffected tissue. This involves processing of frozen sections of all margins in stages (usually on the same day) until all the tumour is removed. The procedure is time-consuming (so can be difficult for elderly, frail patients) and requires particular surgical and pathology skills, but is associated with the highest long-term cure rates, with 98–99% clear at 5-year follow-up.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1445">If a surgical approach is used for management of BCC and the primary tumour is not completely excised, re-excision may be required, although follow-up may be appropriate as not all tumours that are incompletely excised recur.

Cryotherapy may be effective for BCC but can cause blistering and scarring, so is best suited to small, superficial lesions at low-risk sites.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1450">Radiotherapy can be invaluable for large BCC lesions in frail patients but is less commonly used because of the risk of scarring.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1455">Medical therapies can be used to treat low-risk BCC, particularly when surgery is not appropriate for a patient. Topical immunomodulators, such as imiquimod, are effective for low-risk BCC and may be particularly useful for patients who are not able to attend a hospital clinic setting but are able to apply a topical preparation at home over a 6-week period. Imiquimod usually induces a prominent inflammatory reaction and patients should be advised that dose adjustments may be required. Topical 5-fluorouracil can also be effective for low-risk small lesions of superficial BCC, but is rarely used since it usually provokes an intense inflammatory reaction. Intralesional interferon-alpha2b has been used for BCC but multiple treatments and high cost preclude its regular use.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1460">PDT is an effective treatment for low-risk, predominantly superficial BCC, as well as AK and BD. Usually, topical porphyrin PDT is employed, which involves application of a porphyrin prodrug to the lesion to be treated. The prodrug is taken up and converted by the cell's haem cycle to protoporphyrin IX, a photosensitiser. This is photochemically activated by visible (normally red) light, usually delivered by a light-emitting diode (LED), in the presence of oxygen, causing the production of reactive oxygen species, which cause destruction of treated tissue. The photosensitiser is taken up preferentially by diseased skin, and adverse effects in normal skin are minimised. PDT is at least as effective as cryotherapy and surgery for superficial BCC and may be preferred at sites of poor healing, such as the lower leg, or where cosmetic outcome is important. PDT is not as effective as surgery for long-term clearance of nodular BCC but can be considered if surgery is not appropriate. Pain during irradiation may occur during PDT, although adjustments to the irradiation regime can reduce discomfort. PDT is usually undertaken in the outpatient clinic setting and is well suited to frail elderly patients who are not able to undertake treatment with topical agents at home.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1465">Rarely, advanced BCC may be locally invasive or even metastasise.

In the immunosuppressed patient population, such as organ transplant recipients, SCC is the most common skin cancer and its incidence is dramatically increased, particularly in association with the duration of immunosuppression and the degree of sun exposure and damage accrued pre-transplant.

Standard excision with a 4–6 mm margin is advised and the cure rate is approximately 90–95%. Mohs' surgery is an option but is used less frequently for SCC than for BCC. High-risk SCC should be treated aggressively, with a wider margin of excision of at least 6 mm where feasible. This may include larger, thicker lesions, tumours at sites where metastases are more likely, such as the ear, lip or non-sun-exposed sites, and those occurring in the immunosuppressed and/or with histology showing the tumour to be poorly differentiated, with evidence of lymphatic, vascular or perineural involvement or a high mitotic index. Such patients and those with metastatic disease require management via a multidisciplinary team. In patients who are at high risk for further SCC, systemic retinoids may have a role in reducing the rate of SCC development, but rapid appearance of tumours occurs on drug cessation. Occasionally, curettage and cautery may be appropriate if the tumour is small and low-risk and either surgical excision is contraindicated or the patient is unwilling to proceed.

Subsequently, the lesion may become palpable and this is indicative of a vertical growth phase, with dermal invasion; when this occurs, the tumour has the potential to invade lymphatics and vessels and to become metastatic (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0575" refid="f0090">Fig. 29.15A</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0090"/>).

This may account in part for the increased mortality rates from melanoma in men, as these are tumours with greater metastatic risk. They often present as a rapidly growing nodule that may bleed and ulcerate. Nodular melanomas may be heavily pigmented, or relatively amelanotic and erythematous, and be confused with benign vascular lesions.

The initial biopsy should include a 2 mm margin, followed up where possible by wider excision if the diagnosis is confirmed. Occasionally, radiotherapy or imiquimod may be used for lentigo maligna, if surgery is not feasible. The Breslow thickness of the tumour (the maximal depth from epidermal granular cell layer to deepest tumour cells) is critical for management and prognosis. The presence of ulceration may lead to under-estimation of the Breslow thickness. The mitotic rate and the presence or absence of any evidence of lymphovascular or perineural involvement should also be ascertained. The clinical staging of melanoma extent is essential, in order to establish whether disease is primary and localised, or if there is nodal or metastatic spread.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1610">Wide excision of melanoma with a low risk of metastasis (stage 1 disease, Breslow thickness &#x003C; 1 mm) with a 1 cm clear margin is accepted practice. The margin of excision for more advanced disease is controversial, although a 2–3 cm margin for thicker tumours is generally advised as an attempt to reduce risk of local recurrence. There is no evidence that more radical surgery with 4–6 cm margins is beneficial. The majority of tumours can be excised without the need for grafting. For tumours with a Breslow thickness of 1 mm or more, a sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered. This is usually performed at the time of wider excision and involves injection of radio-labelled blue dye at the site of the primary melanoma, allowing identification of the draining ‘sentinel’ node by radioscintigraphy; this sentinel node is then removed and examined in detail by histology, immunohistochemistry and/or PCR of melanocyte gene products to look for tumour deposits. If the biopsy is positive, local lymphadenectomy is usually offered. This procedure provides additional prognostic information but there is no evidence that it improves survival. Local recurrence of disease and palpable local node involvement should be treated surgically. Localised cutaneous metastases or in transit disease may be amenable to palliation with electrochemotherapy if there is no evidence of widespread metastatic disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1615">Despite the major advances in treatment options for advanced melanoma, the prognosis for metastatic disease remains poor and treatment options are palliative. Genetic developments have facilitated the introduction of tumour-targeted treatments for advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic disease, such as the <ce:italic>B-Raf</ce:italic> and <ce:italic>c-Kit</ce:italic> kinase inhibitors for patients expressing these gene mutations, notably dabrafenib and vemurafenib, with demonstrable clinical responses. Immunotherapy with ipilimumab, which blocks T-cell activation by inhibiting CTLA-4, alone or in combination with the programmed cell death (PD1) pathway blockers nivolumab or pembrolizumab, provides clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life and survival to patients with advanced disease. Standard chemotherapy may also be used in some cases of metastatic disease, although outcomes are poor. Other biological and gene therapies and vaccines are also being investigated. It is important for patients with advanced melanoma to be managed through a multidisciplinary team in order to optimise care and facilitate their inclusion in clinical trials.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1620">All patients should be advised regarding ongoing photoprotection, with sensible behaviour in the sun, covering up, wearing hats and high-factor sunscreen use. However, evidence has shown that despite patients with melanoma being advised to photoprotect, many follow this advice only for the first year following diagnosis, thus emphasising the need for ongoing reinforcement of guidance with regard to photoprotection.

All ages can be affected but non-bullous disease particularly affects young children, often in late summer. Outbreaks can arise in conditions of overcrowding and poor hygiene or in institutions.

Genital warts are spread by sexual activity and show a clear relationship with cervical and intra-epithelial cancers of the genital area. HPV-16 and 18 appear to inactivate tumour suppressor gene pathways and lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix or intra-epithelial carcinoma of the genital skin (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0520" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00011-1#s0730">p. 242</ce:intra-ref>).

Individuals with atopic eczema have an increased susceptibility to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and are at risk of developing a widespread infection, eczema herpeticum. The presence of small, punched-out lesions on a background of worsening eczema suggests the possibility of secondary HSV infection. Skin scrapings to rule out secondary fungal infection should also be considered. Total IgE and specific IgE tests and skin prick tests are not routinely undertaken in atopic eczema as they are not usually helpful, although they may occasionally be indicated in some cases as directed by the history. Patch tests should be performed if contact allergic dermatitis is suspected (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0720" refid="b0115">Box 29.22</ce:cross-ref> below).

Input from patient support groups, such as the National Eczema Society in the UK, can be very helpful. Intensive and prolonged treatments are often required and chronic eczema can have a major and devastating adverse impact on personal and family lives. Emollients and topical glucocorticoids are mainstays of treatment for all eczema types, in order to improve skin barrier function, limit transepidermal water loss and reduce inflammation. Emollients can be used as bath additives and soap substitutes, and applied directly to the skin, often combined with antiseptics. Sedative antihistamines are useful if sleep is interrupted but non-sedating antihistamines are ineffective, as the itch of eczema is not primarily mediated by histamine.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2160">Ointments are preferred for chronic eczema, whereas cream- or lotion-based treatment may be more appropriate for acute eczema (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0730" refid="b0060">Box 29.11</ce:cross-ref>). Treatment is once to twice daily (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9405" refid="s0340">p. 1225</ce:cross-ref>). Hydrocortisone (1%) or clobetasone butyrate is generally used on the face, with more potent glucocorticoids restricted to trunk and limbs (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0735" refid="b0065">Box 29.12</ce:cross-ref>). A good strategy is to employ an intensive regimen with more potent glucocorticoids initially and then taper use according to response. A key principle is to use the least potent glucocorticoid that is effective for the shortest possible time. The patient should be given instructions on how much to apply, using the fingertip unit for guidance (a strip of glucocorticoid cream on distal phalanx pulp should cover two palm-size areas). It is also important to monitor glucocorticoid use and the easiest way to do this is ask how long it takes to use a specific size of glucocorticoid tube. The side-effects of topical glucocorticoid therapy need to be considered but glucocorticoid phobia and under-treatment of eczema are often more of a problem than over-treatment. Particular care should be taken on certain sites, such as the face and flexures, and in children and the elderly (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0740" refid="b0015">Box 29.2</ce:cross-ref> and <ce:cross-ref id="crf0745" refid="f0065">Fig. 29.10</ce:cross-ref>, <ce:cross-ref id="crf9410" refid="s0355">p. 1226</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p2165">The clinical features of eczema influence the choice of topical treatment.

Atopic individuals manifest one or more of a group of diseases that includes asthma, hay fever, food and other allergies, and atopic eczema. Genetic factors play an important role in all of these conditions, supported by higher concordance of atopic disease in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins. Filaggrin gene mutations increase the risk of developing atopic eczema by more than threefold, emphasising the importance of epidermal barrier impairment in this disease. Other genes are also likely to be implicated, with many other susceptibility loci identified, although these studies require further replication. Decreased skin barrier function may also allow greater penetration of allergens through the epidermis, and thus cause immune stimulation and subsequent inflammation. The interaction between genes and environment is important; it has been estimated that 60–80% of individuals are genetically susceptible to the induction of IgE-mediated sensitisation to environmental allergens such as food and animal hair. Eczema is characterised by infiltration of Th2 cells, which are known to play a role in activating mast cells and eosinophils, as well as stimulating IgE production by IgE-producing B cells. The contributing roles of the microbiome are also being explored.

Vitamin D receptor agonists, such as calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol, are often used as first-line topical treatment. The mechanism of action includes increased differentiation and reduction of proliferation, reducing plaque scale and thickness. Calcipotriol is most widely used and can be applied once to twice daily; if less than 100 g of ointment is used each week, there is no risk of hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D analogues can cause irritation but this is often temporary. Topical glucocorticoids may be required in the management of psoriasis, particularly at flexural or facial sites, and may be alternated or combined with vitamin D analogues. However, safe, appropriately supervised and judicious use is necessary, with awareness of the potential risk of rebound unstable or pustular psoriasis with glucocorticoid over-use or sudden cessation. Dithranol and coal tar are effective and, like vitamin D analogues, work by increasing differentiation and inhibiting proliferation. Although often effective, they are messy and time-consuming. Modified versions of Goeckerman's regimen (the combination of coal tar and UVB) are still used, but coal tar has a characteristic odour and can be irritant. Short-contact dithranol therapy at relatively high concentrations applied for 15–30 minutes can be used but causes brown staining of skin and purple discoloration of light hair. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the tolerance of tar and dithranol preparations, but at reduced efficacy. Overall, the use of tar and dithranol has reduced in recent years but they can be highly effective in selected patients.</ce:para><ce:para id="p2590">If topical treatment is insufficient, then UVB phototherapy or PUVA should usually be the next step. If the patient continues to have active disease or early recurrence, then the addition of systemic retinoid such as acitretin to UVB or PUVA can be effective.

Usually 1–4 weeks after drug commencement, the patient becomes systemically unwell and often pyrexial. Erythema and blistering develop, initially on the trunk but rapidly involving all skin; an early warning sign is cutaneous pain.

Blisters often follow trauma and milia develop. It can be very difficult to distinguish from other immunobullous diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid. It is caused by an IgG antibody to type VII collagen, which provokes subepidermal blistering and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, although the latter may not be prominent. Direct immunofluorescence on perilesional skin shows IgG and C3 at the dermo-epidermal junction and pattern analysis may be helpful in distinction from bullous pemphigoid. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on salt-split normal human skin typically shows IgG and IgA in the floor of the artificially induced blister, whereas in BP antibody localisation would be to the roof of the blister. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is very difficult to treat, as it often does not respond well to immunosuppressants. Mainstays of treatment include systemic glucocorticoids in combination with dapsone or colchicine.

Phototherapy with narrowband UVB or PUVA can also be used. Narrowband UVB is the most effective repigmentary treatment available for generalised vitiligo, but even very prolonged courses often do not produce a satisfactory outcome. The absence of leucotrichia (white hairs in the area of vitiligo) and the presence of a trichrome pattern (three colours – normal skin colour, hypopigmentation and depigmentation) are good prognostic features. Vitiligo on the face, trunk and proximal limbs is more likely to respond than that on hands and feet.

There is a strong association with diabetes: most patients with necrobiosis lipoidica have or develop diabetes, although less than 1% of diabetic patients develop necrobiosis lipoidica.

Due to this loss of enzyme activity, porphyrin precursors proximal to the implicated enzyme step accumulate. If the accumulated porphyrins absorb visible light, then there will be skin features and photosensitivity, which explains why some porphyrias have skin features (porphyria cutanea tarda) and others do not (acute intermittent porphyria; <ce:intra-ref id="ii0975" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#p3400">p. 379</ce:intra-ref>).

It is caused by an underlying chronic liver disease, in association with hepatic iron overload. The liver disease is often only diagnosed through investigation of the skin presentation and it is thus an important diagnosis not to miss. Typical features are increased skin fragility, blistering, erosions, hypertrichosis, scarring and milia occurring on light-exposed areas, particularly the backs of the hands (<ce:cross-ref id="crf1030" refid="f0275">Fig. 29.52</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0275"/>). Less common features include facial hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation and morphoea-like changes. Variegate porphyria (VP) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) may be indistinguishable on skin features and it is important to make the correct diagnosis, as acute neurovisceral attacks, which may be drug-induced (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9540" refid="s1720">p. 1265</ce:cross-ref>), can occur in VP and HCP but not in PCT. Pseudoporphyria may also be impossible to distinguish from PCT on clinical grounds but is most frequently caused by a drug (commonly naproxen; see <ce:cross-ref id="crf1035" refid="b0180">Box 29.35</ce:cross-ref>) or by sunbed use; on investigation, porphyrins are normal.

It is an important diagnosis to consider. The presentation is usually in early childhood, although the diagnosis is often delayed. In part this is because, although the baby or child cries due to immediate pain on sunlight exposure, physical signs are often absent or minimal and thus a link with sunlight may not always be considered. The deficient ferrochelatase activity leads to accumulation of lipid-soluble protoporphyrins in the skin, explaining the photosensitivity manifest as pain on daylight exposure. Multiple pigment gallstones, anaemia (usually only problematic if considered to be due to iron deficiency) and, rarely, severe liver disease can occur, which may be fatal and requires liver transplantation. In addition to photoprotection, UVB phototherapy may be effective for the symptoms of photosensitivity and, more recently, the use of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) analogues has been explored.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s1660"><ce:section-title id="st1555">Abnormal deposition disorders</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s1665"><ce:section-title id="st1560">Xanthomas</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3495">Deposits of fatty material in the skin, subcutaneous fat and tendons may be the first clue to primary or secondary hyperlipidaemia (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0990" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#s0010">pp. 346</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii1000" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00014-7#p2885">p. 373</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s1670"><ce:section-title id="st1565">Amyloidosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p3500">Cutaneous amyloid may present as periocular plaques in primary systemic amyloidosis (<ce:intra-ref id="ii1005" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00004-4#s0470">p. 81</ce:intra-ref>) and amyloid associated with multiple myeloma, but is uncommon in systemic amyloidosis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or other chronic inflammatory diseases.
