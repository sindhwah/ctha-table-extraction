The raised levels of hCG also act on the thyroid to stimulate T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> (triiodothyronine) and T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> (thyroxine) production, which in turn suppresses thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production by the pituitary. Later in pregnancy, oestradiol and progesterone are derived from the placenta, which also produces human placental lactogen (hPL), impairing glucose tolerance. There is a progressive reduction of free T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> during pregnancy as the result of T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> degradation by the placenta and increased secretion of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) by the liver.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0010" role="short">Fig. 30.1</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0020" locator="f30-001-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000305/f30-001-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0030"><ce:label>Fig. 30.2</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0015"><ce:simple-para id="sp0025" role="title">Symptoms and signs of pre-eclampsia.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0015" role="short">Fig. 30.2</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0070" locator="f30-002-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000305/f30-002-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0035"><ce:label>Fig. 30.3</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0020"><ce:simple-para id="sp0035" role="title">Adverse pregnancy outcomes in chronic kidney disease.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp9010" role="caption">Creatinine is in µmol/L.

These are necessary to support the growing fetus, to prepare for delivery and to support lactation. These changes can adversely affect the activity and progression of many pre-existing medical conditions. Emphasising this fact, information from the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths has revealed that over recent years, two-thirds of maternal deaths occur as the result of pre-existing medical conditions, rather than from obstetric causes. The most common causes of death were cardiac conditions (23%), pneumonia and influenza (14%), and venous thromboembolism (11%). Although some diseases can undergo remission during pregnancy, others can worsen, potentially jeopardising the health and well-being of the mother and fetus. In this chapter, we review the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy and the impact of pregnancy on the diagnosis, clinical course and management of common medical conditions. In addition, we review the pathogenesis and management of several medical conditions specific to pregnancy.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Planning pregnancy in patients with medical conditions</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0155">Patients with pre-existing medical conditions require careful counselling when planning a pregnancy to make them aware of the risks that pregnancy might pose, as well as the changes in symptoms that might be expected to occur during pregnancy. Although each disease is different, as is discussed later in this chapter, the general principles are to ensure that drugs that may be fetotoxic are stopped before pregnancy is attempted; that high-risk patients are kept under close surveillance during their pregnancy; and that new symptoms that emerge during pregnancy are treated seriously and fully investigated where appropriate.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0025">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0160">The most important changes that occur in the anatomy and physiology of major organ systems during pregnancy are discussed below.</ce:para><ce:section id="s9000"><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Bone metabolism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0165">Major changes in bone metabolism take place to meet the demands of the growing fetus. Intestinal calcium absorption increases, due in part to increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>D). Calcium is also released from the maternal skeleton due to increased bone resorption, stimulated by production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by breast and placenta. This results in loss of bone from the maternal skeleton during pregnancy that continues until lactation ceases and then recovers. Serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can increase by up to fourfold but this is due to release of ALP from the placenta rather than bone.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Cardiovascular system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0170">Heart rate and stroke volume increase during pregnancy; when combined with peripheral vasodilatation and a reduction in systemic blood pressure, this causes a hyperdynamic circulatory state and an increase in cardiac output. Diaphragmatic elevation may affect the electrocardiogram (ECG), causing left axis deviation of up to 15°. Other changes include T-wave inversion in leads III and aVF, ST depression, small Q waves and a sinus tachycardia. Supraventricular and ventricular beats are common. Echocardiography shows a modest increase in the dimensions of the cardiac chambers.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Endocrine system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0175">During early pregnancy there is secretion of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) by trophoblast cells, which act on the corpus luteum in the ovary to stimulate oestradiol and progesterone production (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0140" refid="f0020">Fig. 30.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>). Levels of hCG rise rapidly during early pregnancy to reach a peak around 8 weeks, and then fall before stabilising at a lower level from 20 weeks until term. There is a progressive rise in oestradiol and progesterone levels; initially, these hormones are produced by the corpus luteum but placental production takes over after about 12 weeks. The high levels of gonadal hormones suppress pituitary gonadotrophin production but prolactin levels rise about 10-fold and there is an increase in volume of the anterior pituitary. Serum levels of free T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> increase during the first trimester but, paradoxically, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels fall by almost 50%. This is because hCG is homologous to TSH and mimics the effect of TSH on the thyroid, stimulating both T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> production. The raised levels of T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> feed back to the pituitary and reduce TSH secretion. Later in pregnancy, there is increased degradation of thyroxine by the placenta and levels of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) rise, causing the normal range for free T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> to fall progressively during the course of pregnancy. Although TSH levels are difficult to interpret early in pregnancy, they provide the best measure of thyroid function after about 16 weeks' gestation.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Gastrointestinal system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0180">The high levels of progesterone during pregnancy lead to relaxation of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the lower oesophageal sphincter to relax, predisposing to gastro-oesophageal reflux and reduced gastrointestinal transit; this in turn leads to delayed gastric emptying and constipation.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Genitourinary system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0185">Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases during pregnancy due to an increased cardiac output. By the second trimester, renal perfusion increases by up to 80% and GFR by 50%, leading to a fall in serum urea and creatinine. Mild glycosuria may be observed during normal pregnancy due mainly to an increase in filtered load of glucose. The ureters and renal pelvis are slightly dilated, most prominently on the left side, leading to the physiological hydronephrosis of pregnancy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Glucose metabolism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0190">Maternal glucose metabolism changes during pregnancy to optimise delivery of glucose and other nutrients to the fetus. During the second half of pregnancy in particular, there is maternal insulin resistance due largely to an increase in circulating levels of human placental lactogen (hPL) (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0145" refid="f0020">Fig. 30.1</ce:cross-ref>). The net effect is to ensure that glucose is preferentially supplied to the fetus rather than the mother. Following delivery of the placenta, there is a rapid decline in hPL and reversal of insulin resistance. During pregnancy, fasting plasma glucose decreases slightly, while post-prandial blood glucose may increase. Glycosuria may occur, even in women who do not have diabetes, due to the increased GFR. Insulin secretion in the fetus is driven by fetal glucose levels, which in turn are dependent on maternal glucose concentrations. Accordingly, in women with diabetes, maternal hyperglycaemia stimulates fetal insulin secretion, which increases fetal growth, resulting in increased birth weight or macrosomia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Haematological system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0195">Haemoglobin normally falls by about 20% during pregnancy since plasma volume increases more than red cell volume: the so-called physiological anaemia of pregnancy. The reduction in haematocrit lowers blood viscosity but this is offset by an elevation in levels of several clotting factors, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that increases the risk of venous and arterial thrombosis.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section-title id="st0065">Respiratory system</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0200">Tidal volume (TV) increases during pregnancy due to an increased vital capacity and reduced residual volume, and by term the increase in TV is about 200 mL.

While many investigations can proceed as normal during pregnancy, invasive procedures should generally be avoided unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Investigations that can be performed in pregnancy are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0155" refid="b0015">Box 30.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0075"><ce:section-title id="st0075">Imaging</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0225">Imaging during pregnancy should be undertaken only when the clinical benefit outweighs the potential risks to mother and fetus. In suspected pulmonary embolus, radionuclide ventilation/perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scanning is preferred over computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in women with a normal chest X-ray since V̇/Q̇ scans expose the maternal breast and lungs to less radiation than CTPA. However, if the chest X-ray is abnormal, CTPA should be performed, since it is more likely to yield a definitive diagnosis. The radiation exposure for both investigations is well below the maximum recommended fetal radiation dose in pregnancy (5 rad). Chest X-rays may also be performed safely at any gestation during pregnancy if clinically indicated, since the radiation exposure is very low for the fetus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is safe in the second and third trimesters and is useful in the assessment of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and neurological disorders. However, gadolinium-containing contrast agents should be used only if absolutely necessary. If gadolinium contrast agents are used in women who are breastfeeding, the milk should be discarded for 24 hours. Ultrasound imaging is safe during pregnancy and useful in the assessment of patients with DVT or intra-abdominal pathology.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0080"><ce:section-title id="st0080">Presenting problems in pregnancy</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0085"><ce:section-title id="st0085">Breathlessness</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0230">The causes of breathlessness during pregnancy are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0160" refid="b0020">Box 30.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/>. Many women experience mild breathlessness as part of normal pregnancy, which is known as physiological breathlessness of pregnancy. It is thought to be progesterone-mediated and is classically of gradual onset and present at rest and on exercise. Physiological breathlessness does not require investigation but severe or persistent breathlessness should be investigated, especially if accompanied by chest pain. The diagnostic approach in pregnant patients with suspected pulmonary embolism differs from that in non-pregnant women. Measurement of D-dimer is not helpful since values normally increase progressively throughout pregnancy. Accordingly, the first-line investigation in suspected pulmonary embolism is a V̇/Q̇ scan in a patient with a normal chest X-ray and CTPA in a patient with an abnormal chest X-ray.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0090"><ce:section-title id="st0090">Chest pain</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0240">Chest pain does not occur during normal pregnancy but the incidences of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and aortic dissection are both increased.

Obstetric causes include pulmonary embolism, haemorrhage and amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE usually presents with collapse and profound shock during delivery or immediately afterwards, often with profound and early coagulopathy. It can be difficult to differentiate AFE from other causes of maternal collapse, and the diagnosis is clinical when other causes of collapse have been excluded. Management is supportive, with oxygenation, careful fluid balance and, in some cases, correction of coagulopathies, ventilatory support and vasopressors.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0250">Another important cause of circulatory collapse is obstetric haemorrhage, which can be divided into ante-partum and post-partum subtypes. Ante-partum haemorrhage is defined as bleeding from the vagina after 24 weeks' gestation. Primary post-partum haemorrhage is defined as occurring in the first 24 hours after delivery, and secondary post-partum haemorrhage after 24 hours. Haemorrhage may be concealed, and physiological changes such as hypotension, tachycardia and tachypnoea may be late signs. Management is supportive with administration of blood, intravenous fluids and oxygen. Patients with post-partum haemorrhage may also benefit from uterotonic agents such as oxytocin.

Management includes control of blood pressure, administration of magnesium sulphate as prophylaxis against seizures, correction of coagulation abnormalities and monitoring of fluid balance. If pre-eclampsia occurs early in pregnancy, medical management should be initiated with the aim of controlling the condition and maintaining the fetus in utero as long as possible.

Varicella infection can be diagnosed clinically, with laboratory confirmation by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of fluid from vesicles, or by serology. Varicella pneumonia causes an interstitial pneumonitis with a characteristic nodular appearance on chest X-ray (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9030" refid="s0010">p. 1270</ce:cross-ref>).

Medications such as azathioprine, sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), glucocorticoids and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors can be continued as normal during pregnancy but methotrexate must be stopped at least 3 months before conception because of its teratogenic effects. Since poorly controlled IBD is associated with an increased risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight and miscarriage, it is important for the disease to be well controlled before conception. The activity of IBD can increase during pregnancy and ulcerative colitis is more likely to flare than Crohn's disease. Women who experience disease flares should be managed by both medical and obstetric teams, and monitored closely. The TNF-α inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab are actively transported across the placenta in the third trimester and there is theoretical concern about immunosuppression in the neonate. Infants of mothers who have been treated with TNF-α inhibitors during the second and third trimesters should not be given live vaccines and should be monitored closely for any signs of infection. Most women with uncomplicated IBD can have a normal vaginal delivery and do not need a caesarean section, but the need for this should be assessed on an individual basis by obstetric and medical teams.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0190"><ce:section-title id="st0190">Diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0585">It is important to institute meticulous glucose control in pregnancy, as maternal diabetes is associated with increased risks of congenital malformations, stillbirth, pre-eclampsia, pre-term delivery, operative delivery, neonatal hypoglycaemia and admission to neonatal intensive care.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0195"><ce:section-title id="st0195">Gestational diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0590">Gestational diabetes is defined as diabetes with first onset or recognition during pregnancy.

However, in most cases, gestational diabetes develops due to an inability to increase insulin secretion adequately to compensate for pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, and most women can expect to return to normal glucose tolerance immediately after pregnancy.

Controversy remains about who should be screened, and the screening strategy depends, in part, on the population risk. It is widely accepted that women at high risk for gestational diabetes should have an oral glucose tolerance test at 24–28 weeks, and some guidelines recommend that all high-risk women should be screened by measuring HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf>, fasting blood glucose or random blood glucose at the first booking visit. It should be noted that measurements of HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> cannot reliably be used to diagnose diabetes in early pregnancy and until 3 months post-partum, since HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> levels fall due to increased red cell turnover.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0200"><ce:section-title id="st0200">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0605">The aim is to normalise maternal blood glucose concentrations and reduce the risk of excessive fetal growth.

Women with gestational diabetes should undertake regular pre- and post-prandial self-monitoring of blood glucose, aiming for pre-meal blood glucose levels of &#x003C; 5.3 mmol/L (96 mg/dL) and a 1-hour post-prandial level of &#x003C; 7.8 mmol/L (142 mg/dL) or a 2-hour post-prandial level of &#x003C; 6.0 mmol/L (109 mg/dL). If pharmacological treatment is necessary, metformin, glibenclamide or insulin can all be used. Glibenclamide should be used rather than other sulphonylureas because it does not cross the placenta. Other oral therapies or injectable incretin-based therapies should not be given in pregnancy.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0610">After delivery, maternal glucose usually returns to pre-pregnancy levels. In the UK, it is currently recommended that women with gestational diabetes should have a fasting blood glucose measured at 6 weeks post-partum and have HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> concentrations measured annually to screen for the development of diabetes. This is because even those whose glucose tolerance returns to normal post-partum are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, with a 5-year risk between 15 and 50%, depending on the population. Therefore, all women who have had gestational diabetes should be given diet and lifestyle advice to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0060" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00020-2#s0550">p. 743</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0205"><ce:section-title id="st0205">Pregnancy in women with established diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0615">Maternal hyperglycaemia early in pregnancy (during the first 6 weeks post conception) can adversely affect fetal development, causing cardiac, renal and skeletal malformations, of which the caudal regression syndrome (abnormal development of the lower part of the spine) is the most characteristic. The risk of fetal abnormalities is about 2% for non-diabetic women and about 4% for women with well-controlled diabetes (HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> &#x003C; 53 mmol/mol) but more than 20% for those with poor glycaemic control (HbA<ce:inf loc="post">1c</ce:inf> &#x003E; 97 mmol/mol). Therefore, it is important for women with diabetes to aim to achieve good glycaemic control before becoming pregnant. In addition, high-dose folic acid (5 mg daily, rather than the usual 400 µg) should be initiated before conception to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0620">As for gestational diabetes, mothers should attempt to maintain near-normal blood glucose levels while avoiding hypoglycaemia throughout their pregnancy, as this minimises excessive fetal growth and neonatal hypoglycaemia. This is often difficult to achieve, however. Pregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of ketosis, particularly, but not exclusively, in women with type 1 diabetes. Ketoacidosis during pregnancy is dangerous for the mother and is associated with a high rate (10–35%) of fetal mortality.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0625">Pregnancy is linked with a worsening of diabetic complications, most notably retinopathy and nephropathy, so careful monitoring of eyes and kidneys is required throughout pregnancy. If heavy proteinuria and/or renal dysfunction exist prior to pregnancy, there is a marked increase in the risk of pre-eclampsia, and renal function can deteriorate irreversibly during pregnancy. These risks need to be carefully discussed before a woman with diabetes is considering pregnancy. The outlook for mother and child has been vastly improved over recent years but pregnancy outcomes are still not equivalent to those of non-diabetic mothers. Perinatal mortality rates remain 3–4 times those of the non-diabetic population (at around 30–40 per 1000 pregnancies) and the rate of congenital malformation is increased 5–6-fold.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0210"><ce:section-title id="st0210">Endocrine disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0215"><ce:section-title id="st0215">Thyroid disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0220"><ce:section-title id="st0220">Iodine deficiency</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0630">Iodine deficiency is a major public health issue in many countries, particularly in South-east Asia, the Western Pacific and Central Africa.

More moderate iodine deficiency is associated with milder forms of cognitive impairment and affects millions of people. The World Health Organisation recommends a daily iodine intake of 250 µg/day for pregnant women.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common, and is often due to poor adherence to levothyroxine in known primary hypothyroidism. Most pregnant women with primary hypothyroidism require an increase in the dose of levothyroxine of approximately 25–50 µg daily to maintain normal TSH levels because there is an increased requirement for thyroxine during pregnancy. Furthermore, inadequately treated maternal hypothyroidism may be associated with impaired brain development in the fetus. Because of this, hypothyroid women should be monitored closely if planning a pregnancy; they should be advised to have their thyroid function checked as soon as possible after conception and increase their daily levothyroxine dose if necessary. During pregnancy, serum TSH and free T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> should be measured during each trimester and the dose of levothyroxine adjusted to maintain a normal TSH level. Rarely, hypothyroidism may present during pregnancy with weight gain, constipation and lethargy. The diagnosis is easily missed since these symptoms are common in normal pregnancy. If suspected, the diagnosis can be confirmed by checking thyroid function tests, which show a raised TSH and low free T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf>.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0230"><ce:section-title id="st0230">Hyperthyroidism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0640">The coexistence of pregnancy and thyrotoxicosis is unusual, since anovulatory cycles are common in thyrotoxic patients and autoimmune disease tends to remit during pregnancy, due to suppression of the maternal immune response. Thyroid function tests must be interpreted in the knowledge that thyroid-binding globulin, and hence total T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf> and T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> levels, are increased in pregnancy and that the normal range for TSH is lower (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0065" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#b0110">Box 18.18</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0070" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0465">p. 651</ce:intra-ref>). Despite this, a fully suppressed TSH is usually indicative of Graves' disease. When thyroid disease during pregnancy is being dealt with, both mother and fetus must be considered, since maternal thyroid hormones, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) and antithyroid drugs can all cross the placenta to some degree, exposing the fetus to the risks of thyrotoxicosis, iatrogenic hypothyroidism and goitre. Moreover, poorly controlled thyrotoxicosis can result in fetal tachycardia, intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, stillbirth and possibly even congenital malformations.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0645">Antithyroid drugs are the treatment of first choice for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can be treated with β-adrenoceptor antagonists (β-blockers) in the short term, followed by antithyroid drugs. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred antithyroid drug because treatment with carbimazole during the first trimester has been associated with the occurrence of choanal atresia and aplasia cutis. Hyperthyroid women who become pregnant while taking carbimazole or PTU should be advised to continue their current drug in pregnancy, with close monitoring. Both carbimazole and PTU cross the placenta and are effective in treating thyrotoxicosis in the fetus caused by transplacental passage of TRAb. To avoid fetal hypothyroidism, which can affect brain development and cause goitre, it is important to use the smallest dose of antithyroid drug (typically &#x003C; 150 mg PTU or 15 mg carbimazole per day) that will maintain maternal free T<ce:inf loc="post">4</ce:inf>, T<ce:inf loc="post">3</ce:inf> and TSH concentrations within their respective reference ranges. Thyroid surgery is sometimes necessary because of poor drug adherence, drug hypersensitivity or failure of medical treatment and is most safely performed during the second trimester. Radioactive iodine is absolutely contraindicated throughout pregnancy, as it invariably induces fetal hypothyroidism. Frequent review of mother and fetus (monitoring heart rate and growth) is important during pregnancy and in the puerperium. Serum TRAb levels can be measured in the third trimester to predict the likelihood of neonatal thyrotoxicosis. PTU is the drug of choice in the breastfeeding mother, as it is excreted in the milk to a much lesser extent than carbimazole. Thyroid function should be monitored periodically in the breastfed child.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0235"><ce:section-title id="st0235">Post-partum thyroiditis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0650">Post-partum thyroiditis typically presents 3–4 months after delivery.

Macroprolactinomas (≥ 10 mm) are at greater risk of enlarging and may cause optic chiasm compression. If women known to have a prolactinoma become pregnant, they should have visual field testing each trimester, followed by pituitary imaging by MRI if enlargement is suspected from changes in visual fields or from symptoms. Measurement of serum prolactin is generally not helpful, since levels increase anyway as part of normal pregnancy.

The development of symptoms suggestive of diabetes insipidus, such as thirst and polyuria, during pregnancy should raise suspicion of acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), the syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) or pre-eclampsia, as all of these conditions are also associated with decreased breakdown of vasopressinase by the liver.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0255"><ce:section-title id="st0255">Sheehan's syndrome</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0665">This is a form of post-partum hypopituitarism caused by infarction of the pituitary, usually associated with hypotension from major post-partum haemorrhage.

The cause is incompletely understood but the condition is thought to be due in part to the cholestatic effect of high oestrogen levels. The typical presentation is in the third trimester with pruritus, particularly affecting the soles and palms. Laboratory testing reveals raised levels of bile acids and abnormal LFTs. The diagnosis can be made on the basis of these clinical features when other causes of liver dysfunction and pruritus have been excluded. Treatment is with ursodeoxycholic acid in a starting dose of 250 mg twice daily, which usually improves symptoms and liver function. Aqueous cream with menthol can also be effective in soothing pruritus. There is an increased risk of fetal mortality with evidence of a particularly high risk when bile acid levels are over 40 µmol/L (97.9 µg/mL). Treatment therefore aims to bring bile acids below 40 µmol/L and some centres induce labour before 40 weeks in an effort to reduce the risk. The risk of recurrence in future pregnancies is high.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0400"><ce:section-title id="st0400">Viral hepatitis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1000">The course of hepatitis B is unchanged in pregnancy, but it is important to identify women who have active infection to reduce the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus; this risk is up to 90% in women who are hepatitis B e-antigen positive. Vaccinations and immunoglobulin should be given to infants of mothers who test positive for hepatitis B, and antiviral agents should be given to the mother after delivery. Vertical transmission rates of hepatitis C are low in the absence of HIV infection and so no action is required for the infant, unless there is co-infection with HIV; in this case, antiviral drugs should be considered. Pregnant women are at greater risk of contracting hepatitis E than the non-pregnant population. It is transferred via the faeco-oral route, and is usually a mild self-limiting illness outside of pregnancy. However, it can cause fulminant hepatic failure in up to 20% of pregnant women.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0405"><ce:section-title id="st0405">Neurological disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0410"><ce:section-title id="st0410">Epilepsy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1005">Women with epilepsy should have pre-pregnancy counselling and should be advised to take high-dose folic acid from pre-conception; their antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should also be reviewed. Maternal treatment with sodium valproate is associated with a higher rate of fetal malformations than other AEDs, and a reduction in intelligence quotient and an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder in the offspring. Where possible, sodium valproate should be substituted for another AED with a better safety profile in pregnancy, such as lamotrigine, levetiracetam or carbamazepine. While pregnancy does not generally affect the frequency of seizures in women with well-controlled epilepsy, those who enter pregnancy with poorly controlled epilepsy are likely to deteriorate. The plasma levels of some AEDs such as lamotrigine can fall in pregnancy and checking drug levels can be helpful. Seizures are more common at the time of delivery and women should be advised to deliver in a unit staffed with personnel able to manage this.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0415"><ce:section-title id="st0415">Idiopathic intracranial hypertension</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1010">Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may worsen during pregnancy due to weight gain. Treatment with acetazolamide can be continued during pregnancy but should be avoided in the first trimester due to lack of safety data. The mode of delivery is not affected by IIH and spinal analgesia can be given as normal.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0420"><ce:section-title id="st0420">Migraine</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1015">Migraine often improves during pregnancy but if attacks occur they should be managed with simple analgesia and antiemetics. If necessary, prophylaxis can be given with aspirin, β-blockers or tricyclic antidepressants. Safety data on use of triptans during pregnancy are limited but reassuring. Triptans can therefore be used for the treatment of migraine if other therapies are ineffective.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0425"><ce:section-title id="st0425">Stroke</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1020">Stroke is twice as common in pregnant women as in non-pregnant women of the same age. The risk is highest during the third trimester and puerperium. The management of stroke during pregnancy is similar to that in non-pregnant patients. The risk of cerebral venous thrombosis is greatly increased during pregnancy. The presentation is with headache, seizures and neurological deficits such as hemiparesis. If the diagnosis is suspected, neuroimaging should be performed with MRI or CT venography. Management of acute infarct should be as for the non-pregnant patient and include consideration of thrombolysis.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0430"><ce:section-title id="st0430">Psychiatric disorders</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1025">Mood changes are common during pregnancy but more severe psychiatric disorders, such as depression or psychosis, typically present within 2–4 weeks of delivery.

Iron deficiency anaemia is most commonly due to a 20% increased demand for iron. In most cases, it responds well to oral iron supplementation, with a rise in haemoglobin of approximately 0.8 g/L per week. If the haemoglobin does not rise following a 4-week trial of iron supplementation, alternative causes of anaemia should be considered. Non-adherence to oral iron is common and intravenous iron should be considered in women with iron deficiency and failure of oral treatment. It is generally not necessary to investigate iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy unless there is clinical evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss, which should be investigated in the normal way.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0445"><ce:section-title id="st0445">Rhesus disease</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1085">Women who are negative for the Rhesus antigen should be offered treatment with anti-RhD immunoglobulin around the time of delivery to reduce the risk of haemolytic disease of the newborn.

The most common cause is gestational thrombocytopenia, which typically occurs towards the end of pregnancy and resolves spontaneously after delivery. It is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and requires no specific intervention. Pregnancy may occur in women with pre-existing idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, <ce:intra-ref id="ii9010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#p5920">p. 971</ce:intra-ref>). This should be managed with glucocorticoids and/or immunoglobulin, with the aim of maintaining the platelet count above 80 × 10<ce:sup loc="post">9</ce:sup>/L at the time of delivery, in case spinal anaesthesia or caesarean section is required. Thrombocytopenia may also occur as a component of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS, <ce:intra-ref id="ii9015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00015-9#s0580">p. 408</ce:intra-ref>) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP, <ce:intra-ref id="ii9020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#s1830">p. 979</ce:intra-ref>). Both are characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia, but in TTP neurological symptoms and fever also occur. These conditions are rare but important to recognise since up to one-quarter of cases occur during pregnancy and the post-partum period. TTP is managed with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma and sometimes glucocorticoids or rituximab. Platelet transfusion should be avoided.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0455"><ce:section-title id="st0455">Venous thromboembolism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1130">The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 4–5 times higher in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women. DVT is the most common presentation and predominantly affects the left leg in pregnancy, for reasons that are incompletely understood. Doppler ultrasound scan is the investigation of choice, but MRI can also be used if proximal clot is suspected. Measurement of D-dimer is not useful in pregnancy because levels rise as part of normal pregnancy. Treatment of VTE in pregnancy is with LMWH at a higher dose than for the non-pregnant woman, based on the patient's early pregnancy (booking) weight. Women with a previous history of VTE who are receiving warfarin or other oral anticoagulants as prophylaxis should have these stopped prior to conception and LMWH should be substituted.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0460">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs9000"><ce:bib-reference id="bib9001"><ce:label>British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 2014</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr9000"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:surname>British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>SIGN 141 – British guideline on the management of asthma</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:comment>Edinburgh: Health Improvement Scotland</sb:comment><sb:host><sb:book><sb:date>2014</sb:date></sb:book></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib9002"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp9000"><ce:italic>Useful asthma guidelines.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib9003"><ce:label>Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2015</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr9005"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:surname>Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Thromboembolic disease in pregnancy and the puerperium: acute management.
