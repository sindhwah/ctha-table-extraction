acute episodes, often infective, on a background of an otherwise healthy patient. Adult medicine traditionally comprised patients with progressive conditions, and increasing pathology with advancing age. A number of factors have led to the recognition that boundaries between adult medicine and paediatric care are not clear-cut, and recent evidence has confirmed that anticipating and carefully planning the transition of children with long-term conditions (LTCs) into adult services improve care and outcomes. About 14% of children in the developed world are diagnosed with an LTC and in the majority of patients the disorder will persist into adulthood. Common illnesses include asthma, epilepsy, congenital heart disease, diabetes and childhood cancer (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0115" refid="b0010">Box 31.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>). Similar trends are developing worldwide, with increasing survival rates of children with complex pathology, and increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related conditions such as obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Specific factors that make transition planning important in young people with LTCs are outlined in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0120" refid="f0010">Figure 31.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0205">Planning the process of transition from paediatric to adult health services and improving the assessment of young people as they enter those adult services have been shown to impact positively on long-term health outcomes. There is a need for physicians to gain new skills in the care of young people and adults who have conditions that have arisen in childhood. This includes developing specific skills in the management of adolescents and young adults, managing the process of transition and developing knowledge of relevant medical conditions. The overall approach to transition medicine, as well as important disease-specific issues, will be considered in this chapter.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0010"><ce:section-title id="st0010">Transition from paediatric to adult health services</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Effectiveness of transition planning</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0210">A review of the effectiveness of transition planning has confirmed improved health outcomes when specific interventions to improve coordination between adult and paediatric services are implemented. Most research in this field has been undertaken with young people with diabetes, and many of the outcome measures relate to that condition. The principles of transition planning and the potential benefits are, however, likely to be generalisable to other LTCs that present in childhood. Young people with serious LTCs are among the most complex and high-risk patients to care for in adulthood, and it is important to work closely with them as they move to adult services, to try to improve their long-term outcome.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0020">General principles of transition planning</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0215">Paediatric services are organised and delivered in a very different way to adult medical services. They encompass a period of life that spans from infancy to independence, and progress from taking parents' views as paramount to needing to recognise the wishes of the young person. After transition, young people move from medical services that have been family-centred and focused around maximising the child's development, to a service that encourages patient autonomy, in which employment and reproduction are important measures of outcome. At the same time as undergoing transition within medical services, young people are making multiple other transitions in their lives as they move from a dependent to an independent way of living (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0125" refid="f0015">Fig. 31.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0015"/>). They often move away from the family home, and parents who formerly held responsibility for patient management, coordination of care, communication and consent to treatments will be demoted to an advisory role. Paediatric services are not well placed to meet this change in focus from the patient as a child to the patient as an independent adult, and young people benefit from the move to adult services as long as their specific needs as a young adult are recognised.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0025">Principles of prescribing during transition</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0220">Hepatic drug metabolism increases from neonatal levels during childhood, eventually decreasing to adult levels after puberty. Once puberty has been completed, teenagers can be considered, in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic terms, to behave like adults. It is important to remember that many young people have considerably lower body mass and therefore body mass index (BMI) than adults, and care needs to be taken to avoid excessive dosage in physically smaller patients. Likewise, obesity needs consideration in terms of prescribing and drug doses. The general advice is that when prescribing a dose per kilogram, the optimal weight for height rather than actual weight should be used for obese young people.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0030">A systematic approach to transition planning</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0225">Several steps need to be undertaken to develop a successful programme for transition of care.

The first step is to establish a policy in consultation with young people and train staff in the policy. Subsequently, systems need to be developed to identify patients in need of transition and track them as they pass through the programme. Adult health-care providers need to be identified and processes developed for introducing the young person to the adult team. This should be followed by written communication between the paediatric and adult teams, and then a first consultation with the adult team at which the transfer can be reviewed and a care plan developed. There should subsequently be written communication between the adult and paediatric teams to confirm that handover has occurred, followed eventually by integration of the young person's care into the adult service.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0385">A number of organisations have published guidelines to planning transition services.

Transition should generally be initiated at around 12 years of age. Completion time then varies from person to person, also depending on the model of adult services available. Most commonly, full transition occurs between 16 and 18 years of age (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0145" refid="f0020">Fig. 31.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>). This coincides with many other areas where young people are considered to have made the transition to adulthood, such as the completion of formal education.

During this phase, several physical, biochemical and emotional changes occur. The most important are discussed in more detail below.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0115"><ce:section-title id="st0110">Endocrine changes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0595">The hormonal and physical stages of progression through puberty in males and females are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0150" refid="f0025">Figure 31.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>. Puberty is initiated by pulsatile increases in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates pulsatile release of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary. In males, the increased production of LH stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, and FSH acts on Sertoli cells to stimulate sperm production, as described on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0465">page 651</ce:intra-ref> and shown in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#f0090">Figure 18.13</ce:intra-ref>. The rise in testosterone increases skeletal growth, promotes development of the male genital organs and stimulates growth of pubic, facial and axillary hair. In females, FSH and LH act on the ovary to promote follicle production, ovulation and menstruation, as described on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0515">page 652</ce:intra-ref> and shown in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0025" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#f0095">Figure 18.14</ce:intra-ref>. Other hormonal changes in all adolescents include a rise in adrenal androgens and a rise in growth hormone, which in turn stimulates production of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2). Insulin production also rises by about 30% during puberty. These hormonal changes contribute to the biological, morphological and psychological changes seen during the teenage years. Adolescence (as opposed to puberty) comprises not only the physical changes of puberty, but also the wider emotional and psychological changes of progression into early adulthood. The emotional and psychological changes are associated with physical maturation but also with sociocultural influences. The normal feelings and behavioural development of normal adolescence are complex but tend to follow fairly predictable patterns.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0120"><ce:section-title id="st0115">Physical changes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0600">In girls, there is an increased rate of growth, followed soon after by the development of breasts and pubic hair. Menstruation typically starts after the rate of growth has peaked. In boys, puberty begins with testicular enlargement, followed soon after by a growth spurt and the development of pubic hair. In clinical practice, Tanner staging is used as a method of documenting progression of physical changes that occur during puberty (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9005" refid="f0030">Fig. 31.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>). The average age at onset of puberty in the UK is about 11 years in girls and 12 years in boys but normal puberty has a very wide range of onset. Factors that are important in predicting age of onset of normal puberty include family history (age of onset is strongly predicted by the parents' pattern of onset) and body mass, with heavier children entering puberty at a younger age. The current trends towards improved nutritional status and increased obesity in particular are driving earlier onset of puberty. Delayed puberty is defined to have occurred when the age at onset is more than 2.5 standard deviations above the national average, which in the UK is about 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys. If puberty is delayed beyond this point, investigations may be needed to determine the underlying cause, as detailed on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0030" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0520">page 653</ce:intra-ref>. Many children who have had long-term health conditions during childhood experience a delayed onset of puberty because chronic ill health slows longitudinal growth and causes functional hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Glucocorticoid therapy also contributes to growth retardation in children with chronic inflammatory diseases. An X-ray of the left wrist can be used to assess bone age accurately, and a bone age that is more than 2 years behind the chronological age should prompt consideration of further investigations (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0035" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00018-4#s0560">p. 654</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0125"><ce:section-title id="st0120">Cognitive and behavioural changes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0605">As young people move from their early teenage years to later adolescence there is a move away from the family towards personal independence. This is often characterised by change from a self-centred focus, associated with a sense of awkwardness and worries about being normal, towards increased self-confidence and an awareness of weaknesses in parents and others in authority. In late adolescence, young people reach a stage of self-reliance, increased emotional stability and improved ability to think ideas through. Finally, young adults begin to develop firm belief systems, autonomy and independence. With time, there is reduced conflict with parents and other figures in authority and full maturity develops.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0610">In terms of cognition, there is a transition from being mostly interested in the present, in short-term outcomes and instant gratification, through to increased concern for the future and a greater focus on one's longer-term role in life. Sexuality and relationships clarify during adolescence, and individuals move from early awkwardness and uncertainty to a firmer sense of their sexual identity, and then development of more serious and longer-term relationships. In terms of morals and values, young people move from a period of risk-taking behaviour and experimentation through to understanding the potential consequences of such behaviour for their future health and well-being. Young adults develop a greater capacity for setting personal goals and an increased focus on self-esteem. Finally, family, social and cultural traditions regain some of their previous importance, and by the time young people emerge from adolescence, they have usually developed insight and a greater focus on self-esteem and long-term well-being. It is the development of these more mature personality traits that are important for the more active role in health care that is needed to function well within an adult model of medicine. Some teenagers do vary slightly from these broad patterns but the feelings and behaviours described are, in general, considered normal for each stage of adolescence. Understanding these changes in emotional and psychological behaviour underpins the approaches that are needed to meet the challenges of managing long-term conditions in older teenagers and young adults.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0130"><ce:section-title id="st0125">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0615">Several changes take place during adolescence in terms of skeletal growth, organ development and body composition, which can influence the interpretation of results. Examples include fusion of the epiphyses as puberty progresses, increases in bone mineral content and density as the skeleton grows, and changes in the reference range of certain biochemical tests. Most of these changes occur gradually during puberty and there are rarely abrupt alterations in adult biochemical concentrations. It is important to use age-adjusted biochemical reference ranges until puberty has been completed. Several biochemical changes take place in the composition of body fluids between infancy and puberty.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0620">Some of the key changes in biochemical markers are outlined in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0155" refid="b0025">Box 31.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0025"/>.

The elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels during adolescence relates to the bone isoenzyme produced by osteoblasts in the growing skeleton during the growth spurt. Further investigations for raised levels of ALP are not required in adolescence, as long as other liver function tests, including γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), are normal.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0630">In general, under normal physiological conditions, the reference ranges of most biochemical tests remain fairly constant between puberty and menopause in women and between puberty and middle age in men.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0135"><ce:section-title id="st0130">Clinical assessment</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0635">The initial patient consultation at transition is of vital importance for establishing a potentially life-long professional relationship with the patient, as well as identifying key features in the history, examination and assessment of their overall needs. Parents commonly attend a first adult appointment with their son or daughter, and it is usually necessary to allow longer for this initial assessment. Often, the first transition appointment is undertaken jointly with the paediatrician in a specialist transition clinic and this will enable a thorough face-to-face handover of all the key facts.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0640">A detailed transition referral letter should clearly describe the diagnosis, current and previous treatments, and key interventions that have been undertaken while the patient was under the care of paediatric services. It is important to check the main details with the young person and to make sure there are no other factors that they feel are of relevance. There are a few features in the history that merit special attention, particularly at the first consultation, as outlined in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0160" refid="b0030">Box 31.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0030"/>. Many young people with an LTC attend their first adult outpatient department consultation with their parents, and it is important either to create a time to ask personal and lifestyle-related questions separately from the main history – that is, privately – or to make sure that these can be confidentially explored in future.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0140"><ce:section-title id="st0135">Presenting problems in transition medicine</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0145"><ce:section-title id="st0140">Problems with adherence</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0675">Adherence is defined as ‘the extent to which a person's behaviour, in terms of taking medications, following diets, or executing lifestyle changes, coincides with medical or health advice’. The term ‘adherence’ is used in preference to ‘compliance’ because it focuses on whether a person actively adheres to the regimen rather than passively follows the doctor's orders. It also implies partnership and cooperation between the patient and the care-giver. More recently, clinicians have moved to seeking patients' concordance with management plans. Concordance refers to a consultation process that has an underlying ethos of shared decision-making. It has become clear that current levels of adherence do not deliver the full benefits of medication. Historical paternalistic medical practice does not maximise the chances of patients adopting the changes and treatments they need to improve their outcomes. Reaching a concordant position with patients involves a range of approaches (such as patient-centredness or shared decision-making) and a number of specific actions (such as exploring anxieties about medication side-effects, individualising regimes to suit the patient's lifestyle, offering a range of treatment options) and has not been evaluated comprehensively.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0680">Adherence to clinic attendance, investigation and treatment often falls significantly in adolescence and during transition to adult services. Measurement of adherence is challenging and reported rates vary according to the method of assessment. Teenagers may also have varying adherence levels within their treatment regimen. An important example is in patients who have undergone organ transplantation, in whom low adherence to immunosuppressive medication is a significant cause of graft rejection and may cause death. Adherence merits careful consideration when caring for adolescents and young adults, and focusing on strategies to improve adherence at this initial stage of patient management can deliver life-long improvements in health outcomes. Young teenagers mainly believe in things that they have directly experienced and do not fully appreciate the unseen consequences of not taking their medications. In time, adolescents learn to develop hypothetical thinking and to analyse more complex information and decision-making. The ability to engage in formal thinking is inconsistent at first, and at times of stress (such as during an illness) adolescents may regress to more simple ways of problem-solving. Despite their maturing skills, they may remain self-centred and feel invincible. Factors that positively and negatively affect adherence are outlined in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0170" refid="b0035">Box 31.6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0035"/>. Interventions to improve adherence are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0175" refid="b0040">Box 31.7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>.</ce:para><ce:para id="p9005">Recent literature suggests that two-way communication between patients and professionals about medicines leads to improved satisfaction with care, knowledge of the condition and treatment, adherence, health outcomes and fewer medication-related problems. Younger adults and those coming to adult services following transition from paediatric services have very different expectations in terms of the nature of the patient–doctor relationship and are more likely to require a more collaborative approach to development of management plans to maximise their concordance with treatment in the long term.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0190"><ce:section-title id="st0185">High-risk behaviour</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0985">The high-risk behaviour that can be undertaken by adolescents is well documented and is seen across many cultures. It is important to assess this by history-taking at the time of transition (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0180" refid="b0045">Box 31.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0045"/>) Adolescents who have had LTCs during childhood are at greater risk of undertaking harmful behaviour and there is evidence that a poor long-term health outlook is associated with risk-taking behaviour earlier in life.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1135">Globally, the leading causes of death among adolescents are road injury, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, suicide, lower respiratory infections and interpersonal violence; many of these deaths are linked to risk-taking behaviours such as excess alcohol and drug intake. Quite apart from mortality, there are other significant adverse events linked to risk-taking behaviour in adolescents: excess alcohol ingestion is also associated with non-fatal road traffic accidents, unwanted and unprotected sexual activity, and violence as both perpetrator and victim.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1140">There are a number of theories about the neurodevelopmental changes associated with these behaviour changes. At around 11 years of age, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal lobes begin a period of pruning of neuronal axons. It is theorised that these changes represent the start of the process of increasing frontal lobe control. A separate process that occurs at the same time predisposes the adolescent to risk-taking behaviour and impulsivity: frontostriatal reward circuits mature relatively early and encourage the adolescent towards adult activities such as alcohol and drug use, and sexual intercourse, which carry potential health risks. At this stage, the PFC has not yet matured to the point where the individual can assess risk adequately. The PFC and its connections are structurally unable to provide sufficient control. It is thought that this maturational gap in PFC control of the pleasure-seeking brain systems is responsible for the risk-taking lifestyle that characterises the period of adolescence.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1145">A number of studies have investigated personality and other factors that contribute to different risk-taking behaviours during adolescence: essentially, younger adolescents and females tend to rate activities as being more risky, and are therefore less likely to undertake them. Older males and those of lower educational status are higher risk takers. Specific protective factors include high self-esteem and a strong orientation to an internal locus of control; young people who feel they have less control and influence over themselves and their behaviour are more likely to undertake high-risk activities. Many teenagers with serious long-term health conditions are disempowered in a number of ways and there is evidence that they are predisposed to be high risk takers during adolescence. Examples of risk-taking behaviour include not only alcohol and drug intake, but also non-adherence to medicines and other aspects of health care, such as diet in diabetes.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1150">It is not easy to affect behaviour during this period of non-adherence. Isolated educational intervention is not sufficient to improve outcome; for example, there is a wealth of evidence showing that teenagers know about the behaviours needed to prevent transmission of HIV, but many do not adhere to this advice. Long-term health-care providers have an invaluable role in supporting adolescents during this period of their development as adults, as many important health-related and lifestyle habits are established during this period: more than 90% of smokers start smoking in adolescence, and life-long habits around eating and exercise are laid down during the teenage years. Focusing on the needs of the emerging adult for autonomy and using the highest levels of communication and patient engagement significantly improve outcomes for patients with LTCs.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0195"><ce:section-title id="st0190">Unplanned pregnancy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1155">In many parts of the world, females commonly undergo their first pregnancy during or just after adolescence. The median age for first pregnancy varies from 19 years in India and parts of Asia, through to 25 years in the USA and around 30 years in Australia and Western Europe. Teenage pregnancy rates are high across the world (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0185" refid="b0050">Box 31.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0050"/>). Information from the UK suggests that 1 in 6 pregnancies is unplanned, and 1.5% of women between the ages of 18 and 45 face an unplanned pregnancy each year. It is therefore vital to anticipate and discuss the issues surrounding reproductive health with all young people before and during transition, as well as during early adulthood. Young people with serious LTCs have a number of additional factors to be taken into consideration when discussing reproduction, and these discussions need to take place long before a family is planned. General physicians do not need to be able to undertake complex genetic counselling and investigation, but should be able to provide advice about the recurrence risk of common inherited conditions, as well as that of the more common multifactorial LTCs, many of which have an inherited or genetic component.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0200"><ce:section-title id="st0195">Clinical presentations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1165">In almost every clinical setting, there is the potential for a young adult with a serious LTC that has arisen during childhood to present to adult physicians.

The key issues to consider for a number of the most common LTCs of childhood are discussed below.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0205"><ce:section-title id="st0200">Neurological disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0210"><ce:section-title id="st0205">Epilepsy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1170">Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0040" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0690">p. 1097</ce:intra-ref>). Epilepsy that has presented during childhood, as opposed to adulthood, is less often associated with underlying central nervous system malignancy and is well controlled with first-line anticonvulsants in around 80% of cases. Young people who still have epilepsy or are on anticonvulsant therapy as they progress into adulthood are more likely to have underlying structural brain disease, such as cerebral palsy, or have more complex or syndromic epilepsy. In many of them, epilepsy may be associated with learning difficulties or other neurological conditions.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1175">Epilepsy presents several problems during transition. Adherence to medication can be an issue and patients with low adherence to epilepsy medicines have higher mortality, higher hospital admission rates and higher emergency department attendances. Conversely, high adherence rates at initiation of epilepsy therapy are associated with improved long-term seizure freedom and higher seizure freedom at 4 years. Epilepsy can also affect employment options for young people, as about 30% of patients still have breakthrough seizures while on treatment. Certain types of employment, such as working within the emergency services or armed forces, or becoming a pilot or driver of a heavy goods vehicle, may therefore not be possible. Driving restrictions may also limit options for some other occupations (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0045" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0870">p. 1103</ce:intra-ref>). Young women with epilepsy should be advised that oral contraceptives are less effective with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs; they should also be made aware of the risk of teratogenicity with many antiepileptic drugs, most notably sodium valproate, which should be avoided in pregnancy if at all possible. Pre-conceptual counselling is desirable for all young girls with epilepsy and pre-conceptual folic acid supplementation is advisable to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1180">Alcohol use in moderation does not affect seizure control in the majority of patients, but withdrawal from alcohol in dependent patients is epileptogenic and heavy alcohol use should be discouraged.

They may be paraplegic or quadriplegic and most non-ambulatory individuals have significant intellectual disability. This group of patients will be unable to live independently during adulthood and need ongoing long-term care. Delivering medical care to these individuals poses several problems, including practical issues such as consideration of capacity and consent to treatment. Other comorbidities include gastro-oesophageal reflux (often related to abnormal lower oesophageal function), seizures, and feeding difficulties often requiring gastrostomy. These individuals usually require a complex care package involving many members of the multidisciplinary team. There are also risks of abuse and neglect in the care of adults with severe disability and this needs to be borne in mind when considering atypical problems or unusual presentations in this vulnerable patient group. Depending on the severity of the patient's condition, end-of-life care may need to be discussed and planned with the family and other care-givers.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0220"><ce:section-title id="st0215">Muscular dystrophy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1195">The muscular dystrophies are a group of diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. The disorders differ in terms of which muscle groups are affected, the degree of weakness, and the rate of disease and symptom progression. All the inherited muscular dystrophies that present during childhood need active management during transition (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0055" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s2215">p. 1143</ce:intra-ref>). One of the most important and most severe conditions is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is associated with a progressive decline in mobility, coupled with cardiac dysfunction due to cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure requiring respiratory support as the disease progresses. Physicians should ensure that the whole family are aware of the wider genetic issues. Female carriers of the DMD gene can suffer muscle fatigue and are at risk of cardiomyopathy, as well as there being obvious risks for their male offspring. On average, patients with DMD survive until their late teens to early twenties, and those with less severe muscular dystrophies, such as Becker dystrophy, survive until their thirties. Although fertility is reduced, young men with these conditions may themselves father children. Male offspring will be unaffected but all female infants of affected males will be carriers.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1200">As the muscular dystrophies progress, a complex package of care involving a multidisciplinary team is necessary; it should include respiratory input to assess the need for ventilatory support, which is a common endpoint for many patients. At the present time, there is no definitive treatment. Glucocorticoids (0.75 mg/kg/day) have been shown to improve muscle strength and are frequently used, but carry an increased risk of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. New therapeutic approaches are being developed with the aim of ameliorating disease progression in patients with nonsense mutations (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0060" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00003-2#s0055">p. 42</ce:intra-ref>). One involves the use of drugs such as ataluren, which promotes binding of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules at the site of stop codons with a mismatch in one base (near-cognate tRNAs). These cause a full-length protein to be produced with an amino acid substitution rather than a truncated non-functional protein. Patients with DMD usually require social and financial support. It is important to consider end-of-life care plans with patients and family members. Involvement from palliative care teams, as well as psychological, spiritual and wider non-medical support, is essential.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0225"><ce:section-title id="st0220">Respiratory disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0230"><ce:section-title id="st0225">Cystic fibrosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1205">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a single-gene autosomal recessive disorder that affects about 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3000 individuals of Caucasian descent (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0065" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00017-2#s0715">p. 580</ce:intra-ref>). Clinical manifestations are caused by defects in an ion transporter termed the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CTFR) protein. With improved supportive care, the median survival in the UK is now more than 50 years. It is well recognised that young people with life-limiting conditions face particular challenges during transition: individuals often exhibit high-risk behaviour during adolescence, and this was particularly true in the past when long-term survival rates were poor. The rates of non-concordance with medication and with time-consuming physiotherapy and nebuliser regimes are high and adversely affect outcome and survival. Exercise tolerance and employment are likely to be restricted as time progresses, and patients need particular support managing the slow decline in function and well-being that occurs throughout their adult lives.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1210">In terms of fertility and child-bearing potential, the picture is complex and merits detailed discussion with patients. It is not often discussed openly by the paediatrician or during childhood, other than with the parents when the patient is young. The vas deferens is absent in 98% of males with CF and seminal vesicular dysfunction means that ejaculates are low in volume. While boys are infertile, newer reproductive therapies, such as the availability of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, mean that fatherhood is possible. The opportunity for assisted reproduction should be discussed early so that people can make informed choices at an appropriate stage of their lives. Females with CF who have good nutritional status and reasonable health status have normal fertility and genetic counselling should be offered early. Contraception needs to be discussed with women who are not planning a pregnancy, since pulmonary hypertension is an absolute contraindication for the oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Women also need to be advised about the effects of antibiotics on OCP effectiveness. New orally available small-molecule therapies, including lumacaftor and ivacaftor, have recently been licensed; they can partially rectify functional defects in the CTFR and have improved outcome. These drugs are having a positive effect on symptom control and are potentially disease-modifying. Other therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy and mRNA editing therapies, are also being explored as treatments for CF. Common issues encountered during transition of CF patients are summarised in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0070" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00017-2#b0175">Box 17.34</ce:intra-ref> (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0075" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00017-2#p3045">p. 581</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0235"><ce:section-title id="st0230">Cardiovascular disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0240"><ce:section-title id="st0235">Congenital heart disease</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1215">Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital anomaly, affecting about 1% of live births. Among birth defects, CHD is the leading cause of mortality. Maternal illnesses such as rubella and injection of teratogenic agents during pregnancy, along with paternal age, all play roles in pathogenesis. Although some chromosomal anomalies, such as trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and monosomy X (Turner's syndrome), are strongly associated with CHD, these account for only 5% of cases. Microdeletion and single-gene mutations can also be important, such as in DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 microdeletion). Overall, the most common congenital valvular anomalies are aortic and pulmonary stenosis. The most common structural anomaly is ventricular septal defect.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1220">There is a wide range of severity of CHD but many patients with life-limiting conditions (usually complex structural anomalies such as tetralogy of Fallot or hypoplastic left heart syndrome) survive to adulthood. Genetic counselling of affected individuals is important, as there is a 1–2% recurrence risk of any cardiac anomaly in offspring. Affected patients should be transitioned to a cardiologist with experience in CHD since this has become a subspecialty in own right.

These features can cause dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction and an increased risk of supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. HOCM is caused by mutations affecting the genes that encode cardiac sarcomere proteins and is most frequently transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It may present for the first time during adolescence with cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death. Predictive genetic testing is possible but challenging because of the large number of causal mutations. In clinical practice, careful analysis of the family history can be useful in identifying those at risk of inheriting the disease. If no gene anomaly has been identified within a family, first-degree relatives may need screening by electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography. Identification of a genetic anomaly is most helpful in allowing identification of family members who do not need echocardiograms or clinical follow-up. Children of affected parents should be screened every 3 years until puberty, and then annually until 20 years of age. If there is no evidence of HOCM in early adulthood, it is unlikely that the condition will develop in later life.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0250"><ce:section-title id="st0245">Oncology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1230">Around 1 child in 500 will develop cancer by the age of 14 years. Leukaemia is the most common, accounting for about 33% of cases; central nervous system tumours are the next most common, accounting for around 25% of all childhood cancers. Fifty years ago, 75% of children diagnosed with cancer died, but overall survival rates now range from 75% to 80%. Between 60% and 70% of young adults who have survived childhood cancer will develop at least one medical disability, most commonly as a result of their therapy rather than their primary cancer. There is a 3–6-fold increased risk of a second cancer, with an absolute risk of about 10% before 50 years of age. It is therefore important for these individuals to be kept under surveillance during transition and beyond.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1235">Endocrine and reproductive disturbances are the most common late effects, affecting 40–60% of survivors. Infertility can be an issue in both males and females receiving cytotoxic medications, unless it has been possible to store semen and ovarian tissue in advance of treatment. Other long-term risks include hypopituitarism, growth hormone deficiency and pubertal delay (especially in boys) from brain irradiation. Radiotherapy to the neck can cause hypothyroidism and increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Total-body irradiation offered as conditioning for bone marrow transplantation affects both ovarian and testicular function, and many of the chemotherapeutic agents used have adverse effects on fertility. Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure is typically associated with high-dose alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, and this is an independent risk factor for premature ovarian failure. In recent years, patients have been offered ovarian and testicular tissue retention and fertility issues are being discussed with families during childhood, but often the patients themselves have limited levels of knowledge of the details. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy in childhood significantly reduce ovarian reserves. When combined with the progressive ovarian decline that occurs in all women throughout adulthood there is a significant risk of premature menopause or ovarian failure, with 8% of survivors affected. Young women need to be aware of these risks during their early adulthood to help with family and lifestyle planning; for example, they may wish to plan to have children earlier in their adult life rather than risking ovarian decline.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1240">Cardiomyopathy is another complication of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Serious cardiac complications include arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy from myocardial necrosis, and angina or myocardial infarction arising from vaso-occlusion or vasospasm.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1245">In addition to physical effects, children who have faced life-threatening illness in childhood may experience psychological and family difficulties during adulthood.

The most common causes during childhood and adolescence are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0190" refid="b0055">Box 31.10</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0055"/>. The primary pathology can be varied and many conditions have no specific treatment, but the overall approach to management of progressive renal insufficiency is the same. Internationally agreed definitions of CKD staging in children differ from those in adults and are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0195" refid="b0060">Box 31.11</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0060"/>. In adults the rate of albumin excretion is included in CKD definitions, as outcome correlates with the level of albuminuria, but in children similar data are lacking and so the staging system is based on glomerular filtration rate alone. The majority of children with CKD stage 3 or higher will ultimately require renal replacement therapy but the timescale for reaching this stage can vary widely. The mainstay of support is to delay progression by treatment of secondary factors that are known to be associated with progressive decline in renal function: namely, hypertension, proteinuria and anaemia.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s9000"><ce:section-title id="st9000">Organ transplantation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1295">Children requiring renal replacement therapy are the most common recipients of kidney transplants in childhood. Liver and heart transplantation, followed by lung and small bowel transplantation, are well-recognised but less commonly undertaken procedures. Non-adherence to immunosuppressive regimes during adolescence is a well-known risk factor for graft failure. The reported incidence of graft failure due to non-adherence is 10–15% but this is likely to be an under-estimate. Rates of non-adherence are highest among adolescents and young adults. As well as non-adherence to immunosuppression, non-adherence to testing and clinic attendance adversely affects the care and outcome of around 1 in 8 kidney transplant patients. Poor adherence is associated with patients with worse psychological status and family dysfunction; adherence has been shown to improve with education and increased motivational factors, as might be expected. This offers the opportunity to improve graft survival. At present, 50% of cadaveric grafts and around 68% of live donor grafts are still functioning 10 years post-transplant. There is no clear difference between children and adults in survival of transplanted kidneys.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1300">Many medications used in transplant medicine and in renal disease can have long-term effects on health. Inhibition of linear growth is seen even with low doses of glucocorticoids, such as 0.125 mg/kg/day on a long-term basis. Alternate-day regimes are generally considered preferable in childhood. The height reduction associated with long-term glucocorticoid use in childhood is dose-dependent, and even for children with asthma treated with inhaled glucocorticoids, an average height reduction of 1.2 cm is reported. This is can also be associated with delayed puberty, as well as an increased risk of osteoporosis in adulthood. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are a well-recognised and potentially life-threatening complication in solid organ recipients. PTLD is the most common malignancy complicating solid organ transplantation, accounting for 20% of all cancers. They represent a range of lymphoproliferative disorders, from infectious mononucleosis and lymphoid hyperplasia to malignant lymphoma. Most cases of PTLD are associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), leading to uncontrolled B-cell proliferation and tumour formation. Up to 10% of solid organ transplant recipients develop PTLD but the risk is almost four times higher in patients under 20 years of age, as opposed to those aged 20–50. This increased risk relates mainly to the development of EBV infection after transplantation; most adults are already EBV-seropositive at the time of transplantation and therefore at lower risk of this complication. The type of organ transplant that has been undertaken predicts PTLD risk, with the cumulative incidence over 5 years ranging from 1–2% in haematopoietic cell transplant and liver transplants, 1–3% in renal transplants, 2–6% in heart transplants and 2–9% in lung transplants to as high as 11–33% in intestinal or multi-organ transplants. The different rates possibly relate to the varying degrees of immunosuppression required. The incidence of PTLD is highest in the first year after transplantation, when it is associated with the highest levels of immunosuppression.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0260"><ce:section-title id="st0255">Diabetes</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1305">Adherence and concordance with medication are a particular challenge in adolescents who have developed diabetes during childhood (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0100" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00020-2#s0725">p. 753</ce:intra-ref>). Studies of adolescents with type 1 diabetes have revealed that 25% were neglecting insulin injections, 81% were not following their diet, and 29% were not measuring their glucose level and were completing a daily diary with fictitious results.

Current treatment aims are outlined in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0210" refid="b0070">Box 31.13</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0070"/>. Standard measures include exclusive enteral nutrition for 6–8 weeks using a whole-protein (polymeric) formula, which induces initial remission in 80% of children. This is equivalent to glucocorticoid therapy but offers improved nutritional status and superior mucosal healing. Glucocorticoids can also be used to induce remission, as well as to treat exacerbations, but should be followed up by immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine or methotrexate. Adolescents and children are more likely than adults to require biologics and around 20% need treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Around 20% of children with CD require surgery within 5 years of diagnosis; limited resections and stricturoplasty are considered best practice to preserve gut length and prevent short bowel syndrome (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0110" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00019-6#s0310">p. 707</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p1375">Children with ulcerative colitis (UC) are more likely than adults to present with pancolitis (approximately 80% versus 40–50% in adults). Mild disease should be treated initially with oral 5-ASA preparations such as mesalamine or sulfasalazine. If the response is inadequate, oral glucocorticoids can be used, but caution must be exercised because of the adverse effects on skeletal growth and bone mineral density. Thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine are frequently used as steroid-sparing agents, with progression to anti-TNF-α therapy for those who still do not respond. There is less evidence for efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors in adolescents with UC than those with CD; they seem to be effective at inducing an initial response but less useful for maintaining long-term remission, since a significant proportion of patients still require colectomy (20% at 1 year) or long-term glucocorticoids. Ciclosporin is probably more effective than infliximab in teenagers with refractory UC. As with other adolescents who have long-term conditions, adherence to medication is particularly important to reduce the risk of relapse. In terms of lifestyle advice, smoking is a particular risk since it increases both the rate and severity of relapses. Body image can be a particular challenge for young adults with IBD, and those with colostomies or fistulae, for example, can find this part of their illness particularly difficult. Delayed puberty and short stature are important comorbidities, partly related to medication side effects and also to the nature of the inflammatory bowel disease itself.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0275"><ce:section-title id="st0270">Rheumatology and bone disease</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0280"><ce:section-title id="st0275">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1380">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the term used to describe a wide variety of inflammatory rheumatic diseases that present during childhood (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0115" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00024-X#p4230">p. 1026</ce:intra-ref>). Oligoarticular juvenile arthritis has a good prognosis and often remits during adulthood, and so transitioning patients to adult rheumatology services may not always be required. The same does not hold true for systemic JIA and polyarticular JIA, which often require long-term immunosuppressive therapy through transition and beyond into adulthood. Smoking is a risk because it increases the activity of inflammatory disease and reduces the effectiveness of biologics. Adherence to and concordance with medication remain a challenge, as in other chronic diseases. Functional limitation secondary to joint damage may limit employment opportunities.

Adherence to phosphate supplements and, to a lesser extent, vitamin D metabolites represents an important issue in optimising management during childhood and this becomes even more challenging in transitioning patients. While skeletal deformity does not progress following closure of the epiphyses, different problems arise in adolescent patients when there is suboptimal control of hypophosphataemia, including painful pseudofractures and arthralgia associated with enthesopathy.

They bring with them specific medical risks and complications related to their previous medical treatment, and knowledge of these is important to identify the long-term complications of the therapies to which they have been exposed. They are a patient group that can display complex and often abnormal illness behaviour. Understanding this and implementing an effective process for transition from paediatric to adult services can reduce the significant risks that these patients face in early adulthood. As they mature and develop more adult intellectual and emotional behaviour patterns, the risks to their health and well-being reduce. Patients in transition can be a particularly challenging group to manage, but investment of time and effort at this stage of their lives can be extremely rewarding and can bring significant improvements in long-term health-related outcomes.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0295">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0010"><ce:section-title id="st0300">Books and journal articles</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib9001"><ce:label>Atreja, Bellam, Levy, 2005</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr9000"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>A</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Atreja</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>N</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Bellam</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>SR</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Levy</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Strategies to enhance patient adherence: Making it simple</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>MedGenMed</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>7</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2005</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>4</sb:first-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib1"><ce:label>Crowley, Wolfe, Lock, McKee, 2011</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0010"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>R</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Crowley</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>I</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Wolfe</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>K</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Lock</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>M.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>McKee</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Improving the transition between paediatric and adult healthcare: a systematic review</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Arch Dis Child</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>96</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2011</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>548</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>553</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib9002"><ce:label>Segal, 2008</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr9005"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>TY</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Segal</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Adolescence: what the cystic fibrosis team needs to know</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>J R Soc Med</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>101</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:issue-nr>Suppl 1</sb:issue-nr><sb:date>2008</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>15</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>27</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference></ce:further-reading-sec><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0015"><ce:section-title id="st0305">Websites</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib2"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0015"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0010" xlink:href="http://acpm.org/?Adherence">acpm.org/?Adherence</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib3"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0035"><ce:italic>American College of Preventive Medicine: detailed review of adherence.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib4"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0020"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0015" xlink:href="http://GotTransition.org">GotTransition.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib5"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0040"><ce:italic>Sample clinical tools and measurement resources for quality improvement purposes.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib6"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0025"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0020" xlink:href="http://uhs.nhs.uk">uhs.nhs.uk</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib7"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0045"><ce:italic>More clinical tools and measurement resources.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference></ce:further-reading-sec></ce:further-reading></chapter>
