A good knowledge of the effects of ageing and the clinical problems associated with old age is therefore essential in most medical specialties. The older population is extremely diverse; a substantial proportion of 90-year-olds enjoy an active healthy life, while some 70-year-olds are severely disabled by chronic disease. The terms ‘chronological’ and ‘biological’ ageing have been coined to describe this phenomenon. Biological rather than chronological age is taken into consideration when making clinical decisions about, for example, the extent of investigation and intervention that is appropriate.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0250">Geriatric medicine is concerned particularly with frail older people, in whom physiological capacity is so reduced that they are incapacitated even by minor illness. They frequently have multiple comorbidities, and acute illness may present in non-specific ways, such as delirium, falls or loss of mobility and day-to-day functioning. These patients are prone to adverse drug reactions, partly because of polypharmacy and partly because of age-related changes in responses to drugs and their elimination (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00002-0#s0495">p. 32</ce:intra-ref>). Disability is common, but patients' function can often be improved by the interventions of the multidisciplinary team (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9195" refid="b0010">p. 1303</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0255">Older people have been neglected in research terms and, until recently, were rarely included in randomised controlled clinical trials. Accordingly, there is often little high-quality evidence on which to base practice.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:section-title id="st0025">Demography</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0260">The demography of all countries has changed rapidly in recent decades. For example, in the UK, the total population has grown by 11% over the last 30 years, but the number of people aged over 65 years has grown by 24%. The steepest rise occurred in those aged over 85 – from 600 000 in 1981 to 1.5 million in 2011; this number is projected to increase to 2.4 million by 2026, while the working-age population (20–64 years) is expected to grow by only 4% between 2011 and 2026. Similarly, the proportion of people over 65 in India has increased by 35.5% from 76 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2011, which is almost twice the rate of growth of the general population over this period. In both of these countries and many others across the world, the old-age dependency ratio, which is the ratio of people of working age for each person over retirement age, has substantially increased. Since young people support older members of the population both directly and indirectly through taxation and pension contributions, the consequences of a reduced ratio are far-reaching. It is important to emphasise, however, that many older people support the younger population, through the care of children and other older people.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0265">Life expectancy in the developed world is now prolonged, even in old age (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0095" refid="b0035">Box 32.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0035"/>); women aged 80 years can expect to live for a further 10 years. However, rates of disability and chronic illness rise sharply with ageing and have a major impact on health and social services. In the UK, the reported prevalence of a chronic illness or disability sufficient to restrict daily activities is around 25% in those aged 50–64, but 66% in men and 75% in women aged over 85.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0275">Although the proportion of the population aged over 65 years is greater in developed countries, two-thirds of the world population aged over 65 live in developing countries at present, and this is projected to rise to 75% in 2025. The rate of population ageing is much faster in developing countries (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0100" refid="f0025">Fig. 32.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>) and so there will be less time to adjust to its impact.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Biology of ageing</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0280">Ageing can be defined as a progressive accumulation through life of random molecular defects that build up within cells and tissues. Eventually, and despite multiple repair and maintenance mechanisms, these result in age-related functional impairment of tissues and organs. There is evidence that variants in many genes contribute to ageing. The implicated genes include those that are involved in regulation of DNA repair, telomere length (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00003-2#u0170">p. 41</ce:intra-ref>) and insulin signalling. Genetic factors only account for around 25% of the variance in human lifespan, however; nutritional and environmental factors determine the rest. At a cellular level, production of reactive oxygen species is thought to play a major role in ageing. These molecules cause oxidative damage at a number of targets:<ce:list id="ulist0065"><ce:list-item id="u0210"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0285"><ce:italic>Nuclear chromosomal DNA</ce:italic>, causing mutations and deletions that ultimately lead to aberrant gene function and potential for malignancy.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0215"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0290"><ce:italic>Telomeres</ce:italic>, the structures at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division because telomerase (which copies the end of the 3′ strand of linear DNA in germ cells) is absent in somatic cells. When telomeres are sufficiently eroded, cells stop dividing. It has been suggested that telomeres represent a ‘biological clock’ that prevents uncontrolled cell division and cancer. Telomeres are particularly shortened in patients with premature ageing due to Werner's syndrome, in which DNA is damaged due to lack of a helicase.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0220"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0295"><ce:italic>Mitochondrial DNA and lipid peroxidation</ce:italic>, resulting in reduced cellular energy production and ultimately cell death.</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0225"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0300"><ce:italic>Proteins</ce:italic>, especially those that are modified by glycosylation due to spontaneous reactions between proteins and sugars.

There is evidence in some organisms that this interplay is mediated by insulin signalling pathways. Chronic inflammation also plays an important role, again in part by driving the production of reactive oxygen species.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Physiological changes of ageing</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0310">The physiological features of normal ageing have been identified by examining disease-free populations of older people to separate the effects of pathology from those due to age alone. The fraction of older people who age without disease ultimately declines to very low levels, however, so that use of the term ‘normal’ becomes debatable. There is a marked increase in inter-individual variation in function with ageing; many physiological processes deteriorate substantially when measured across populations but some individuals show little or no change. This heterogeneity is a hallmark of ageing, meaning that each person must be assessed individually and that the same management cannot be applied unthinkingly to all people of a certain age.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0315">Although some genetic influences contribute to heterogeneity, environmental factors, such as poverty, nutrition, exercise, cigarette smoking and alcohol misuse, play a large part, and a healthy lifestyle should be encouraged even when old age has been reached.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0320">The effects of ageing are usually not enough to interfere with organ function under normal conditions but reserve capacity is significantly reduced. Some changes of ageing, such as depigmentation of the hair, are of no clinical significance. <ce:cross-ref id="crf0105" refid="f0030">Figure 32.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/> shows the many changes that occur with ageing that are clinically important.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Frailty and multimorbidity</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0325">Frailty is defined as the loss of an individual's ability to withstand minor stresses because the reserves in function of several organ systems are so severely reduced that even a trivial illness or adverse drug reaction may result in organ failure and death. The same stresses would cause little upset in a fit person of the same age.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0330">It is important to understand the difference between ‘disability’, ‘multimorbidity’ and ‘frailty’. Disability indicates established loss of function while frailty indicates increased vulnerability to loss of function. Disability may arise from a single pathological event (such as a stroke) in an otherwise healthy individual. After recovery, function is largely stable and the patient may otherwise be in good health. When frailty and disability coexist, function deteriorates markedly even with minor illness, to the extent that the patient can no longer manage independently.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0335">Multimorbidity (the number of diagnoses present) is also not equivalent to frailty; it is quite possible to have several diagnoses without major impact on homeostatic reserve. Multimorbidity is, however, an important concept in its own right and is an almost invariable accompaniment to advanced age. Recent Scottish population-based data show that 60% of those aged 65 and over have at least two chronic diseases. Multimorbidity is a driver for future disability, hospitalisation and death, and often leads to polypharmacy, as multiple medications are used to treat each chronic disease individually. Current health-care systems are poorly equipped to manage multimorbidity; each disease is dealt with by a separate team of specialists, which at best places a high burden on the patient, and at worst leads to mutually incompatible approaches to management of each disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0340">Unfortunately, the term ‘frail’ is often used rather vaguely, sometimes to justify a lack of adequate investigation and intervention in older people. It can be specifically identified, however, by assessing function in a number of domains. Two main approaches to evaluating frailty exist: measurement of physiological function across a number of domains, an example being the Fried Frailty score (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0110" refid="b0040">Box 32.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>), or use of a score based on the number of deficits or problems, such as the Rockwood score.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0380">Frail older people particularly benefit from a clinical approach that addresses both the precipitating acute illness and their underlying loss of reserves. It may be possible to prevent further loss of function through early intervention; for example, a frail woman with myocardial infarction will benefit from specific cardiac investigation and drug treatment, but may benefit even further from an exercise programme to improve musculoskeletal function, balance and aerobic capacity, with nutritional support to restore lost weight. Establishing a patient's level of frailty also helps inform decisions regarding further investigation and management, and the need for rehabilitation.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0385">One of the most powerful tools in the management of older people is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, which identifies all the relevant factors contributing to their presentation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9200" refid="s0010">p. 1302</ce:cross-ref>). Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is in fact a misnomer; it is not merely an assessment, but a process of identifying and managing all relevant factors affecting the health and well-being of older people. It is iterative in nature, management being followed by reassessment and a new management plan. In frail patients with multiple pathology, it may be necessary to perform the assessment in stages to allow for their reduced stamina. The outcome should be a management plan that not only addresses the acute presenting problems but also improves the patient's overall health and function.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0390">Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is performed by a multidisciplinary team (<ce:cross-ref id="crf9205" refid="b0010">p. 1303</ce:cross-ref>). Such an approach was pioneered by Dr Marjory Warren at the West Middlesex Hospital in London in the 1930s; her comprehensive assessment and rehabilitation of supposedly incurable, long-term bedridden older people revolutionised the approach of the medical profession to frail older people and laid the foundations for the modern specialty of geriatric medicine. There is excellent evidence from systematic reviews that Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, when performed by a specialist team on a specialist geriatric medicine ward, reduces death or deterioration, increases the chances of living independently at home, and may also improve cognitive function in the short to medium term. Current evidence suggests that the process works when delivered on a specialist inpatient unit, but the evidence for effectiveness when it is delivered by a visiting team or in the community is less strong.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Decisions about investigation and treatment</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0395">Accurate diagnosis is important at all ages but frail older people may not be able to tolerate lengthy or invasive procedures, and diagnoses may be revealed for which patients could not withstand intensive or aggressive treatment. On the other hand, disability should never be dismissed as due to age alone. For example, it would be a mistake to supply a patient no longer able to climb stairs with a stair lift when simple tests would have revealed osteoarthritis of a hip and vitamin D deficiency, for which appropriate treatment would have restored his or her strength. So how do doctors decide when and how far to investigate?</ce:para><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:section id="s0070"><ce:section-title id="st0065">The views of the patient and family</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0400">Older people may have strong views about the extent of investigation and the treatment they wish to receive, and these should be sought from the outset. A key issue is to establish what the patient wants from investigation and treatment. Many older people do not desire prolongation of life; rather they aspire to maintain physical function, gain relief from symptoms, and preserve the ability to live independently. Such aims differ widely between patients, however, and a careful exploration of what is important to the individual is essential. If the patient wishes, the views of relatives can also be taken into account. If the patient is not able to express a view or lacks the capacity to make decisions because of cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, then relatives' input becomes particularly helpful. They may be able to give information on views previously expressed by the patient or on what the patient would have wanted under the current circumstances. However, families should never be made to feel responsible for difficult decisions.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0075"><ce:section-title id="st0070">The patient's general health</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0405">Does this patient have the physical and mental capacity to tolerate the proposed investigation?

The presence of comorbidity and frailty is more important than age itself in determining this. When a patient with severe heart failure and a previous disabling stroke presents with a suspicious mass lesion on chest X-ray, detailed investigation and staging may not be appropriate if they are not fit for surgery, radical radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Patients with recurrent falls are commonly frail, with multiple medical problems and chronic disabilities.

The most effective intervention is balance and strength training by physiotherapists or exercise practitioners; an alternative with good evidence is tai chi training. An assessment of the patient's home environment for hazards should be undertaken by an occupational therapist, who may also provide personal alarms so that patients can summon help, should they fall again. Rationalising psychotropic medication may help to reduce sedation, although many older patients are reluctant to stop hypnotics. If postural hypotension is present (defined as a drop in blood pressure of &#x003E; 20 mmHg systolic or &#x003E; 10 mmHg diastolic pressure on standing from supine), reducing or stopping hypotensive drugs may be helpful. Evidence supporting the efficacy of other interventions for postural hypotension is lacking but drugs, including fludrocortisone and midodrine, are sometimes used to try to improve dizziness on standing.

If any of the above issues is problematic, the medication should be deprescribed. This may need to be done in a controlled manner, with dose reduction to ensure that rebound symptoms or withdrawal effects do not occur.

These benefits accrue from complex multicomponent interventions, but occupational therapy to improve personal ADLs and individualised exercise interventions have now been shown to be effective in improving functional outcome in their own right.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:sections><ce:further-reading id="fr0010"><ce:section-title id="st0250">Further information</ce:section-title><ce:further-reading-sec id="fs0010"><ce:section-title id="st0255">Websites</ce:section-title><ce:bib-reference id="bib1"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0010"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0020" xlink:href="http://americangeriatrics.org">americangeriatrics.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib2"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0045"><ce:italic>American Geriatrics Society: education, careers vignettes from geriatricians, advocacy and clinical guidelines.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib3"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0015"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0025" xlink:href="http://bgs.org.uk">bgs.org.uk</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib4"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0050"><ce:italic>British Geriatrics Society: useful publications on management of common problems in older people and links to other relevant websites.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib5"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0020"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0030" xlink:href="http://cochrane.org">cochrane.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib6"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0055"><ce:italic>Cochrane review CD006211 Comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults admitted to hospital; CD007146 Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib7"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0025"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0035" xlink:href="http://eugms.org">eugms.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib8"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0060"><ce:italic>European Union Geriatric Medicine Society: research, position papers and educational resources.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib9"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0030"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0040" xlink:href="http://iagg.info">iagg.info</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib10"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0065"><ce:italic>International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics: promoting care of older people and the science of gerontology globally; research, policy and educational resources.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib11"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0035"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0045" xlink:href="http://knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/effectiveolderpeoplecare.aspx">knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/effectiveolderpeoplecare.aspx</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib12"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0070"><ce:italic>Collates and summarises the Cochrane evidence for best practice in the healthcare and rehabilitation of frail older people.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib13"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0040"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0050" xlink:href="http://profane.co">profane.co</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib14"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0075"><ce:italic>Prevention of Falls Network Earth: focuses on the prevention of falls and improvement of postural stability in older people.</ce:italic></ce:simple-para></ce:note></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib17"><ce:label>,</ce:label><sb:reference id="sr0050"><sb:host><sb:e-host><ce:inter-ref id="iw0060" xlink:href="http://qfracture.org">qfracture.org</ce:inter-ref></sb:e-host></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib18"><ce:label>,</ce:label><ce:note><ce:simple-para id="sp0085"><ce:italic>Fracture risk calculator validated in the UK population.
