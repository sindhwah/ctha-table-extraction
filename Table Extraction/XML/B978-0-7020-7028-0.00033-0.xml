By 2030, it is projected that there will be 26 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths per year. The developing world is disproportionately affected by cancer and in 2008 developing nations accounted for 56% of new cancer cases and 75% of cancer deaths.

Cigarette smoking accounts for more than 20% of all global cancer deaths, 80% of lung cancer cases in men and 50% of lung cancer cases in women worldwide, which could be prevented by smoking cessation. Diet and alcohol contribute to a further 30% of cancers, including those of the stomach, colon, oesophagus, breast and liver. Lifestyle modification could reduce these if steps were taken to avoid animal fat and red meat, reduce alcohol, increase fibre, fresh fruit and vegetable intake, and avoid obesity.

Multistep carcinogenesis results from successive clonal expansions of pre-malignant cells, each expansion being triggered by acquisition of a random enabling genetic mutation. Under normal circumstances, cellular DNA repair mechanisms are so effective that almost all spontaneous mutations are corrected without producing phenotypic changes, keeping the overall mutation rates very low. In cancer cells, the accumulation of mutations can be accelerated by compromising the surveillance systems that normally monitor genomic integrity and force genetically damaged cells into either senescence or apoptosis. They can therefore become more sensitive to mutagenic actions or develop DNA repair mechanism failure.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0025"><ce:label>2</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0025">Resisting cell death</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0375">There are three principal mechanisms through which cell death occurs in healthy tissues: apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Apoptosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0380">This is programmed cell death. It is frequently found at markedly reduced rates in cancers, particularly those of high grade or those resistant to treatment. The cellular apoptotic system has regulatory elements that sense intrinsic and extrinsic pro-apoptotic signals and initiate a cascade of proteolysis and cell disassembly with nuclear fragmentation, chromosomal condensation, and shrinking of the cell with loss of intercellular contact, followed by cellular fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by neighbouring cells. The most important regulator of apoptosis is the <ce:italic>TP53</ce:italic> tumour suppressor gene, often described as the ‘guardian of the genome’, as it is able to induce apoptosis in response to sufficient levels of genomic damage. The largest initiator of apoptosis via <ce:italic>TP53</ce:italic> is cellular injury, particularly that due to DNA damage from chemotherapy, oxidative damage and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Autophagy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0385">This is a catabolic process during which cellular constituents are degraded by lysosomal machinery within the cell. It is an important physiological mechanism; it usually occurs at low levels in cells but can be induced in response to environmental stresses, particularly radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, which induce elevated levels of autophagy that are cytoprotective for malignant cells, thus impeding rather than perpetuating the killing actions of these stress situations. Severely stressed cancer cells have been shown to shrink via autophagy to a state of reversible dormancy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Necrosis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0390">This is the premature death of cells and is characterised by the release of cellular contents into the local tissue microenvironment, in marked contrast to apoptosis, where cells are disassembled in a step-by-step fashion and the resulting cellular fragments are phagocytosed. Necrotic cell death results in the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells, promotion of angiogenesis, and release of stimulatory factors that increase cellular proliferation and tissue invasion, thereby enhancing rather than inhibiting carcinogenesis.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:label>3</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0045">Sustaining proliferative signalling</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0395">Cancer cells can sustain proliferation beyond what would be expected for normal cells; this is typically due to growth factors, which are able to bind to cell surface-bound receptors that activate an intracellular tyrosine kinase-mediated signalling cascade, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression and promoting cellular proliferation and growth. Sustained proliferative capacity can result from over-production of growth factor ligands or receptors and production of structurally altered receptors, which can signal in the absence of ligand binding and activation of intracellular signalling pathway components, so that signalling is no longer ligand-dependent.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0050">The cell cycle</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0400">The cell cycle is composed of four ordered, strictly regulated phases referred to as G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> (gap 1), S (DNA synthesis), G<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf> (gap 2) and M (mitosis) (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0180" refid="f0030">Fig. 33.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0030"/>). Normal cells grown in culture will stop proliferating and enter a quiescent state called G<ce:inf loc="post">0</ce:inf> once they become confluent or are deprived of serum or growth factors. The first gap phase (G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf>) prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis represents the period of commitment that separates M and S phases as cells prepare for DNA duplication. Cells in G<ce:inf loc="post">0</ce:inf> and G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> are receptive to growth signals, but once they have passed a restriction point, they are committed to enter DNA synthesis (S phase). Cells demonstrate arrest at different points in G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> in response to different inhibitory growth signals. Mitogenic signals promote progression through G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> to S phase, utilising phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00003-2#s0030">p. 40</ce:intra-ref>). Following DNA synthesis, there is a second gap phase (G<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>) prior to mitosis (M), allowing cells to repair errors that have occurred during DNA replication and thus preventing propagation of these errors to daughter cells. Although the duration of individual phases may vary, depending on cell and tissue type, most adult cells are in a G<ce:inf loc="post">0</ce:inf> state at any one time.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Cell cycle regulation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0405">The cell cycle is orchestrated by a number of molecular mechanisms: most importantly, by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins bind to CDKs and are regulated by both activating and inactivating phosphorylation, with two main checkpoints at G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf>/S and G<ce:inf loc="post">2</ce:inf>/M transition. The genes that inhibit progression play an important part in tumour prevention and are referred to as tumour suppressor genes (e.g. <ce:italic>TP53</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>TP21</ce:italic>, <ce:italic>TP16</ce:italic> genes). The products of these genes deactivate the cyclin–CDK complexes and are thus able to halt the cell cycle. The complexity of cell cycle control is susceptible to dysregulation, which may produce a malignant phenotype.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0060"><ce:section-title id="st0060">Stimulation of the cell cycle</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0410">Many cancer cells produce growth factors, which drive their own proliferation by a positive feedback known as autocrine stimulation. Examples include transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Other cancer cells express growth factor receptors at increased levels due to gene amplification or express abnormal receptors that are permanently activated. This results in abnormal cell growth in response to physiological growth factor stimulation or even in the absence of growth factor stimulation (ligand-independent signalling). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over-expressed in lung and gastrointestinal tumours and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu receptor is frequently over-expressed in breast cancer. Both receptors activate the Ras–Raf–mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, causing cell proliferation.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0065"><ce:label>4</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0065">Evading growth suppressors</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0415">In healthy tissues, cell-to-cell contact in dense cell populations acts as an inhibitory factor on proliferation. This contact inhibition is typically absent in many cancer cell populations. Growth-inhibitory factors can modulate the cell cycle regulators and produce activation of the CDK inhibitors, causing inhibition of the CDKs. Mutations within inhibitory proteins are common in cancer. Loss of restriction by disruption of pRB regulation can be found in human tumours, which produces a loss of restraint on transition from G<ce:inf loc="post">1</ce:inf> to S phase of the cell cycle. Disruption of <ce:italic>TP53</ce:italic> function will have downstream effects on <ce:italic>p21</ce:italic> that alter the coordination of DNA repair with cycle arrest, and that result in the affected cell accumulating genomic defects. Down-regulation of <ce:italic>p21</ce:italic> and <ce:italic>p27</ce:italic>, which can be found in tumours with normal <ce:italic>TP53</ce:italic> function, correlates notably with high tumour grade and poor prognosis.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0070"><ce:label>5</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0070">Enabling replicative immortality</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0420">For cancer cells to evolve into macroscopic tumours, they need to acquire the ability for unlimited proliferation. Telomeric DNA sequences, which protect and stabilise chromosomal ends, play a central role in conferring this limitless replicative potential. During replication of normal cells, telomeres shorten progressively as small fragments of telomeric DNA are lost with successive cycles of replication. This shortening process is thought to represent a mitotic clock and eventually prevents the cell from dividing further. Telomerase, a specialised polymerase enzyme, adds nucleotides to telomeres, allowing continued cell division and thus preventing premature arrest of cellular replication. The telomerase enzyme is almost absent in normal cells but is expressed at significant levels in many human cancers.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0075"><ce:label>6</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0075">Inducing angiogenesis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0425">All cancers require a functional vascular network to ensure continued growth and will be unable to grow beyond 1 mm<ce:sup loc="post">3</ce:sup> without stimulating the development of a vascular supply.

Malignant cells are eventually transported through haematogenous and lymphatic spread to distant sites within the body, where they form micrometastases that will eventually grow into macroscopic metastatic lesions (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0195" refid="f0035">Fig. 33.3</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0445">Cadherin-1 (CDH1) is a calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion glycoprotein that facilitates assembly of organised cell sheets in tissues, and increased expression is recognised as an antagonist of invasion and metastasis.

Mesenchymal stem cells in tumour stroma have been found to secrete CCL5, a protein chemokine that helps recruit leucocytes into inflammatory sites. With the help of particular T-cell-derived cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)), CCL5 induces proliferation and activation of natural killer cells and then acts reciprocally on cancer cells to stimulate invasive behaviour. Macrophages at the tumour periphery can foster local invasion by supplying matrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteinases and cysteine cathepsin proteases.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0085"><ce:label>8</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0085">Reprogramming energy metabolism</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0455">Under aerobic conditions, oxidative phosphorylation functions as the main metabolic pathway for energy production; cells process glucose, first to pyruvate via glycolysis and thereafter to carbon dioxide in the mitochondria. While under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis is favoured to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Cancer cells can reprogram their glucose metabolism to limit energy production to glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. This has been termed ‘aerobic glycolysis’. Up-regulation of glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, is the main mechanism through which aerobic glycolysis is achieved.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0460">This reprogramming of energy metabolism appears paradoxical, as overall energy production from glycolysis is significantly lower (18-fold) than that from oxidative phosphorylation.

Migration across the endothelium occurs via the process of diapedesis, where chemokine gradients stimulate adhered leucocytes to move between endothelial cells and pass through the basement membrane into the surrounding tissues. Once within the tissue interstitium, leucocytes bind to extracellular matrix proteins via integrins and CD44 to prevent their loss from the site.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0475">As well as cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of pre-formed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the complement system activated by bacteria, and the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems activated by necrosis, and also in burns and trauma, as well as cancer. Other bioactive molecules, such as growth factors and pro-angiogenic factors, may be released by inflammatory immune cells into the surrounding tumour microenvironment. In particular, the release of reactive oxygen species, which are actively mutagenic, will accelerate the genetic evolution of surrounding cancer cells, enhancing growth and contributing to cancer progression.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0095"><ce:label>10</ce:label><ce:section-title id="st0095">Evading immune destruction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0480">The immune system operates as a significant barrier to tumour formation and progression, and the ability to escape from immunity is a hallmark of cancer development.

Sometimes, these give strong pointers to the molecular or cellular causes of the disease, such as the association between aflatoxin production within contaminated food supplies and hepatocellular carcinomas. For many solid cancers, such as breast and colorectal, however, there is evidence of a multifactorial pathogenesis, even when there is a principal environmental cause (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0200" refid="b0040">Box 33.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0510">Smoking is now established beyond all doubt as a major cause of lung cancer, but there are obviously additional predisposing factors since not all smokers develop cancer. Similarly, most carcinomas of the cervix are related to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV subtypes 16 and 18). For carcinomas of the bowel and breast, there is strong evidence of an environmental component. For example, the risk of breast cancer in women of Far Eastern origin remains relatively low when they first migrate to a country with a Western lifestyle, but rises in subsequent generations to approach that of the resident population of the host country. The precise environmental factor that causes this change is unclear but may include diet (higher intake of saturated fat and/or dairy products), reproductive patterns (later onset of first pregnancy) and lifestyle (increased use of artificial light and shift in diurnal rhythm).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0115"><ce:section-title id="st0110">Genetic factors</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0515">A number of inherited cancer syndromes are recognised that account for 5–10% of all cancers (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0205" refid="b0045">Box 33.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0045"/>).

Tumours that are exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy, such as germ cell tumours and lymphoma, can be treated with chemotherapy alone, but for most other tumours mediastinal radiotherapy is required. This relieves symptoms within 2 weeks in 50–90% of patients. In many centres, stenting is now increasingly favoured over radiotherapy, as it produces rapid results and can be repeated with reasonable effectiveness. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with tumours that are relatively chemo- or radio-resistant, such as non-small cell lung cancer or carcinoma of unknown primary.

Myelosuppression is common to almost all cytotoxics and this not only limits the dose of drug but also can cause life-threatening complications. The risk of neutropenia can be reduced with the use of specific growth factors that accelerate the repopulation of myeloid precursor cells. The most commonly employed is G–CSF, which is widely used in conjunction with chemotherapy regimens that induce a high rate of neutropenia. More recently, it has been used to ‘accelerate’ the administration of chemotherapy, enabling standard doses to be given at shorter intervals where the rate-limiting factor has been the time taken for the peripheral neutrophil count to recover.

The biological effect of ionising radiation is to cause lethal and sublethal damage to DNA. Since normal tissues are also radiosensitive, treatment has to be designed to maximise exposure of the tumour and minimise exposure of normal tissues. This is possible with modern imaging techniques such as CT and MRI, which allow better visualisation of normal and tumour tissue. In addition, techniques such as conformal radiotherapy, in which shaped rather than conventional square or rectangular beams are used, allow much more precise targeting of therapy to the tumour, and reduce the volume of normal tissue irradiated by up to 40% compared to non-conformal techniques.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1285">Biological differences between normal and tumour tissues are used to obtain therapeutic gain. Fundamental to this is fractionation, which entails delivering the radiation as a number of small doses on a daily basis. This allows normal cells to recover from radiation damage but recovery occurs to a lesser degree in malignant cells. Fractionation regimens vary, but radical treatments given with curative intent are usually delivered in 20–30 fractions given daily on 5 days a week, over 4–6 weeks. Radiotherapy can be extremely useful for the alleviation of symptoms, and for palliative treatments such as this a smaller number of fractions (1–5) is usually adequate.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1290">Both normal and malignant tissues vary widely in their sensitivity to radiotherapy. Germ cell tumours and lymphomas are extremely radiosensitive and relatively low doses are adequate for cure, but most cancers require doses close to or beyond that which can be tolerated by adjacent normal structures. Normal tissue also varies in its radiosensitivity, the central nervous system, small bowel and lung being among the most sensitive. The side-effects of radiotherapy (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0295" refid="f0060">Fig. 33.6</ce:cross-ref>) depend on the normal tissues treated, their radiosensitivity and the dose delivered.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0405"><ce:section-title id="st0390">Adverse effects</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1295">An acute inflammatory reaction commonly occurs towards the end of most radical treatments and is localised to the area treated. For example, skin reactions are common with breast or chest wall radiotherapy, and proctitis and cystitis with treatment to the bladder or prostate. These acute reactions settle over a period of a few weeks after treatment, assuming normal tissue tolerance has not been exceeded. Late effects of radiotherapy develop 6 weeks or more after treatment and occur in 5–10% of patients. Examples include brachial nerve damage and subcutaneous fibrosis after breast cancer treatment, and shrinkage and fibrosis of the bladder after treatment for bladder cancer. There is a risk of inducing cancer after radiotherapy, which varies depending on the site treated and on whether the patient has had other treatment such as chemotherapy.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0410"><ce:section-title id="st0395">Hormone therapy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1300">Hormone therapy is most commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer. Breast tumours that are positive for expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER) respond well to anti-oestrogen therapy, and assessment of ER status is now standard in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Several drugs are now available that reduce oestrogen levels or block the effects of oestrogen on the receptor. When targeted appropriately, adjuvant hormone therapy reduces the risk of relapse and death at least as much as chemotherapy, and in advanced cases can induce stable disease and remissions that may last months to years, with acceptable toxicity. Hormonal manipulation may be effective in other cancers. In prostate cancer, hormonal therapy (e.g. luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues such as goserelin and/or anti-androgens such as bicalutamide) aimed at reducing androgen levels can provide good long-term control of advanced disease, but there is no convincing evidence that it is an effective therapy following potentially curative surgery. Progestogens are active in the treatment of endometrial and breast cancer. In the metastatic setting, progestogen use (e.g. megestrol acetate) is associated with response rates of 20–40% in endometrial cancer. In breast cancer, progestogens are used in patients whose disease has progressed with conventional anti-oestrogen therapy.

Although solid tumours show little benefit, interferons are active in melanoma and lymphoma, and there is evidence that they are beneficial as adjuvants (after surgery and chemotherapy, respectively) to delay recurrence. Whether interferon-induced stimulation of the immune system is capable of eradicating microscopic disease remains unproven. More powerful immune responses can be achieved with potent agents like IL-2 but the accompanying systemic toxicity is a problem still to be overcome. The most striking example of successful immunotherapy is that with rituximab, an antibody against the common B-cell antigen CD20. It increases complete response rates and improves survival in diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma when combined with chemotherapy, and is effective in palliating advanced follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0090" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00023-8#u3295">p. 965</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0420"><ce:section-title id="st0405">Biological therapies</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1310">Advances in knowledge about the molecular basis of cancer have resulted in the development of a new generation of treatments to block the signalling pathways responsible for the growth of specific tumours.

Adjuvant hormonal therapy improves disease-free and overall survival in pre- and post-menopausal patients who have tumours that express ER. Patients at low risk, with tumours that are small and ER-positive, require only adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen. Patients with tumours that are ER-positive and who are pre-menopausal should receive an LHRH analogue. Aromatase inhibitors also have benefit in this setting but are still under investigation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1400">Adjuvant chemotherapy is considered for patients at higher risk of recurrence. Factors that increase the risk of recurrence include a tumour of &#x003E; 1 cm, a tumour that is ER-negative or the presence of involved axillary lymph nodes. Such patients should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy, which improves disease-free and overall survival. The role of adjuvant treatment has been studied by meta-analyses and data support the use of adjuvant trastuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to HER2, in addition to standard chemotherapy for women with early HER2-positive breast cancer.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1405">Metastatic disease management includes radiotherapy to palliate painful bone metastases and second-line endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors, which inhibit peripheral oestrogen production in adrenal and adipose tissues. Advanced ER-negative disease may be treated with combination chemotherapy.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0490"><ce:section-title id="st0470">Ovarian cancer</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1410">Ovarian cancer is the most common gynaecological tumour in Western countries. Most ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin (90%), and up to 7% of women with ovarian cancer have a positive family history. Patients often present late in ovarian cancer with vague abdominal discomfort, low back pain, bloating, altered bowel habit and weight loss. Occasionally, peritoneal deposits are palpable as an omental ‘cake’ and nodules in the umbilicus (Sister Mary Joseph nodules).</ce:para><ce:section id="s0495"><ce:section id="s0500"><ce:section-title id="st0475">Pathogenesis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1415">Genetic and environmental factors play a role. The risk of ovarian cancer is increased in patients with <ce:italic>BRCA1</ce:italic> or <ce:italic>BRCA2</ce:italic> mutations, and Lynch type II families (a subtype of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, HNPCC) have ovarian, endometrial, colorectal and gastric tumours due to mutations of mismatch repair enzymes. Advanced age, nulliparity, ovarian stimulation and Caucasian descent all increase the risk of ovarian cancer, while suppressed ovulation appears to protect, so pregnancy, prolonged breastfeeding and the contraceptive pill have all been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0505"><ce:section-title id="st0480">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1420">Initial workup for patients with suspected ovarian cancer includes imaging in the form of ultrasound and CT. Serum levels of the tumour marker CA-125 are often measured. Surgery plays a key role in the diagnosis, staging and treatment of ovarian cancer, and in early cases, palpation of viscera, peritoneal washings and biopsies are generally performed to define disease extent.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0510"><ce:section-title id="st0485">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1425">In early disease, surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel, is the treatment of choice. Surgery should include removal of the tumour along with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. Even in advanced disease, surgery is undertaken to debulk the tumour and is followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, typically using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Bevacizumab is indicated for patients with high-grade tumours that are suboptimally debulked or those with a more aggressive biological pattern. Monitoring for relapse is achieved through a combination of serum CA-125 and clinical examination with CT imaging for those with suspected relapse. Second-line chemotherapy is aimed at improving symptoms and should not be used for CA-125 elevation only in the absence of symptoms. Treatments can include further platinum/paclitaxel in combination, liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan. These regimens are associated with a response rate of 10–40%. The best responses are observed in patients with a treatment-free interval of more than 12 months.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0515"><ce:section-title id="st0490">Endometrial cancer</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1430">Endometrial cancer accounts for 4% of all female malignancies, producing a 1 in 73 lifetime risk. The majority of patients are post-menopausal, with a peak incidence at 50–60 years of age. Mortality from endometrial cancer is currently falling.

Where the tumour extends beyond the inner 50% of the myometrium or involves the cervix and local lymph nodes, or there is lymphovascular space invasion, adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy is recommended. Chemotherapy is used as adjuvant therapy and hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are used to palliate symptoms in recurrent disease.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0540"><ce:section-title id="st0510">Cervical cancer</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1450">This is the second most common gynaecological tumour worldwide and the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancer.

Infection with HPV has an important causal role, and this has underpinned the introduction of programmes to immunise teenagers against HPV in an effort to prevent the later development of cervical cancer (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0190" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00013-5#p1135">p. 342</ce:intra-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0555"><ce:section-title id="st0520">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1460">Diagnosis is made by smear or cone biopsy. Further examination may require cystoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy if there are symptoms referable to the bladder, colon or rectum. In contrast to other gynaecological malignancies, cervical cancer is a clinically staged disease, although MRI is often used to characterise the primary tumour. A routine chest X-ray should be obtained to help rule out pulmonary metastasis. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is performed to look for metastasis in the liver and lymph nodes, and to exclude hydronephrosis and hydroureter.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0560"><ce:section-title id="st0525">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1465">This depends on the stage of disease. Pre-malignant disease can be treated with laser ablation or diathermy, whereas in microinvasive disease a large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) or a simple hysterectomy is employed. Invasive but localised disease requires radical surgery, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, may be given as primary treatment, especially in patients with adverse prognostic features such as bulky or locally advanced disease, or lymph node or parametrium invasion. In metastatic disease, cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be beneficial in improving symptoms but does not increase survival significantly.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0565"><ce:section-title id="st0530">Head and neck tumours</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1470">Head and neck cancers are typically squamous tumours that arise in the nasopharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. They are most common in elderly males but now occur with increasing frequency in a younger cohort, as well as in women, especially where oropharyngeal cancers are concerned. The rising incidence of oropharyngeal cancers, especially in the developed world, is thought to be secondary to HPV infection. Presentation depends on the location of the primary tumour and the extent of disease. For example, early laryngeal cancers may present with hoarseness, while more extensive local disease may present with pain due to invasion of local structures or with a lump in the neck. Patients who present late often have pulmonary symptoms, as this is the most common site of distant metastases (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0315" refid="b0130">Box 33.19</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0130"/>).</ce:para><ce:section id="s9000"><ce:section id="s0570"><ce:section-title id="st0535">Pathogenesis</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1570">The tumours are strongly associated with a history of smoking and excess alcohol intake, but other recognised risk factors include Epstein–Barr virus for nasopharyngeal cancer and HPV infection for oropharyngeal tumours.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0575"><ce:section-title id="st0540">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1575">Careful inspection of the primary site is required as part of the staging process, and most patients will require endoscopic evaluation and examination under anaesthesia.

In localised disease where there is no involvement of the lymph nodes, long-term remission can be achieved in up to 90% of patients with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of surgery versus radiotherapy often depends on patient preference, as surgical treatment can be mutilating with an adverse cosmetic outcome. Patients with lymph node involvement or metastasis are treated with a combination of surgery and radiotherapy (often with chemotherapy as a radiosensitising agent – proven agents include cisplatin or cetuximab), and this produces long-term remission in approximately 60–70% of patients. Recurrent or metastatic tumour may be palliated with further surgery or radiotherapy to aid local control, and systemic chemotherapy has a response rate of around 20–30%. Second malignancies are common (3% per year) following successful treatment for primary disease, and all patients should be encouraged to give up smoking and drinking alcohol to lower their risk.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0585"><ce:section-title id="st0550">Carcinoma of unknown origin</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1585">Some patients are found to have evidence of metastatic disease at their initial presentation, prior to diagnosis of a primary site.

There is a compromise, however, between exhaustive investigation and obtaining sufficient information to plan appropriate management. For all patients, histological examination of an accessible site of metastasis is required. The architecture of the tissue can assist the pathologist in determining the likely primary site, and therefore it is better to perform a biopsy rather than fine needle aspiration. The greater volume of tissue permits the use of immunohistochemistry. Extensive imaging to search for the primary is rarely indicated; a careful history to identify symptoms and risk factors (including familial) will often permit a judicious choice of imaging and other diagnostic tests, reserving additional tests for specific patients (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0320" refid="b0135">Box 33.20</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0135"/>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0600"><ce:section-title id="st0560">Management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1645">Management of the patient will depend on that person's circumstances, as well as on the site(s) involved and the likely primary sites. The overriding principle is to ensure that a curable diagnosis has been excluded. For example, lung metastases from a testicular teratoma do not preclude cure; nor do one or two liver metastases from a colorectal cancer. Early discussion with an oncologist within a multidisciplinary team is essential and avoids unnecessary investigation; for example, a single hCG-based pregnancy test in a young man with lung metastases might confirm the presence of a teratoma and allow rapid administration of potentially curative chemotherapy. Treatment should not necessarily wait for a definitive diagnosis; appropriate analgesia, radiotherapy and surgical palliation can all be helpful. Some patients remain free of cancer for some years after resection of a single metastasis of an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, justifying this approach in selected patients.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1650">In those with no obvious primary, systemic chemotherapy may achieve some reduction in tumour burden and alleviation of symptoms, but long-term survival is rare.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0605"><ce:section-title id="st0565">Multidisciplinary teams</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1655">The multidisciplinary team (MDT) is well established in oncology and meets on a regular basis to discuss patient progress and provide a forum for patient-centred, interdisciplinary communication to coordinate care and decision-making.
