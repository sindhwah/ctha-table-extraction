Pain signals are detected in the periphery by nociceptors, which are activated by chemicals, changes in pH and cytokines. The signal is transmitted by the primary afferent neuron to the spinal cord, where there is a synapse with a second-order neuron, which transmits the signal onwards to the thalamus. Thereafter, the pain signal is transmitted to the cerebral cortex. The intensity of pain signals is subject to extensive modulation at several levels within the nervous system. Cognitive influences derived from the frontal lobe, coupled with sensory influences from cortex and emotional influences from the amygdyla, affect pain perception in the mid-brain around the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVM) in the medulla. These structures form part of the descending modulatory systems, which, under normal circumstances, inhibit pain perception. In some chronic pain states, however, dysfunction of the descending pathways can occur, increasing pain.</ce:simple-para></ce:caption><ce:alt-text id="atte0015" role="short">Fig. 34.2</ce:alt-text><ce:link id="ln0020" locator="f034-002-9780702070280" xlink:href="pii:B9780702070280000342/f034-002-9780702070280" xlink:role="http://data.elsevier.com/vocabulary/ElsevierContentTypes/23.4" xlink:type="simple"/></ce:figure><ce:figure id="f0020"><ce:label>Fig. 34.3</ce:label><ce:caption id="ca0020"><ce:simple-para id="sp0035" role="title">Mechanisms of peripheral sensitisation.</ce:simple-para><ce:simple-para id="sp0040" role="caption"><ce:bold>A</ce:bold> Sensory nerve terminating with nociceptor in skin. <ce:bold>B</ce:bold> Peripheral nociceptors express various receptors and ion channels that act as mediators of pain.

id="st0010">Pain</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0100">Pain is defined as ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage’. It is one of the most common symptoms for which people seek health-care advice. Our understanding of the mechanisms of pain has evolved considerably from Hippocrates' suggestion in 450 BC that pain arose as a result of an imbalance in vital fluids. We now know that pain is a complex symptom that is influenced and modified by many social, cultural and emotional factors, as illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0100" refid="f0010">Figure 34.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0010"/>. The sensation of acute pain that occurs in response to inflammation or tissue damage plays an important role in protection from further injury. Chronic pain serves no useful function but results in significant distress and suffering for the patient affected, as well as having a wider societal impact.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0015"><ce:section-title id="st0015">Functional anatomy and physiology</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0105">The functional anatomy of the somatosensory system is shown in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0010" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#f0030">Figures 25.3</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii0015" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#f0045">25.6</ce:intra-ref> (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0020" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0030">pp. 1065</ce:intra-ref> and <ce:intra-ref id="ii0025" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0055">1068</ce:intra-ref>). Here, discussion will focus on the mechanisms and mediators that are involved in pain processing.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0020"><ce:section-title id="st0020">Peripheral nerves</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0110">Peripheral nerves contain several types of neuron. These can be classified into two groups, depending on whether or not they are surrounded by a myelin sheath. Myelinated neurons have a fast conduction velocity and are responsible for transmission of various sensory signals, such as proprioception, light touch, heat and cold, and the detection of localised pains, such as pin-prick. Unmyelinated fibres have a much slower conduction velocity and are responsible for transmitting diffuse and poorly localised pain, as well as other sensations (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0105" refid="b0010">Box 34.1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0010"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0120">Sensory neurons (also known as primary afferent neurons) connect the spinal cord to the periphery and supply a defined territory or a dermatome, which can be used to identify the position of a nerve lesion (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii9000" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#f0065">Fig. 25.10</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0030" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0120">p. 1071</ce:intra-ref>). In healthy individuals dermatomes have distinct borders, but in pathological pain syndromes these may become blurred as the result of neuronal plasticity, which means that pain may be felt in an area adjacent to that supplied by a specific nerve root. Autonomic neurons also contain pain fibres and are responsible for transmitting visceral sensations, such as colic. In general, visceral pain is diffuse and less well localised than pain transmitted by sensory neurons.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0125">Anatomical features of the afferent pain pathway are illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0110" refid="f0015">Figure 34.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0015"/>. Pain signals are transmitted from the periphery to the spinal cord by sensory neurons.

There is considerable modulation of pain messages at this site, both from local neurons within the spinal cord and from neurons that descend from the brain, as depicted in <ce:intra-ref id="ii0035" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#f0070">Figure 25.11</ce:intra-ref> (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0040" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#p1085">p. 1072</ce:intra-ref>). Several neurotransmitters are involved in pain processing at this level and these are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0115" refid="b0015">Box 34.2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0015"/>. They include amino acids, such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are inhibitory, and glutamate, which is excitatory; neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP); and endorphins. Whether or not they increase or decrease pain perception depends on the connectivity of the neurons on which they act.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0030"><ce:section-title id="st0030">Central processing of pain</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0165">The signals transmitted by second-order neurons in the spinal cord are relayed to the sensory cortex by third-order neurons, which synapse with second-order neurons in the thalamus. At this site, perception of pain is influenced by interactions between a range of structures in the brain, where sensory, cognitive and emotional aspects are integrated. This is termed the pain neuromatrix (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0125" refid="f0015">Fig. 34.2</ce:cross-ref>). Signals within the neuromatrix are multidirectional in nature, involving modulation of incoming messages by the cerebral cortex (top-down regulation), as well as a complex network of connections between other subcortical structures. Under normal conditions, there is a degree of descending inhibition from the brainstem that reduces input from peripheral stimuli.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0170">It is thought that chronic widespread pain (CWP) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia may result, at least in part, from abnormalities in central processing of pain signals. It has also been suggested that variations in the levels of descending inhibition between individuals may make some people more vulnerable than others to developing chronic pain. Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the role that glial cells (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0045" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#f0020">Fig. 25.1</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0050" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00025-1#s0015">p. 1064</ce:intra-ref>) play in pain processing. Both astrocytes and microglial cells can become activated in chronic pain states and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as altering re-uptake of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which can influence pain perception considerably. As our understanding of these processes improves, there is increasing potential to develop novel therapies targeted at these mediators, with some early clinical studies in neuropathic pain.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0035"><ce:section-title id="st0035">Sensitisation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0175">Sensitisation is one of the key features of pain processing. It refers to the fact that both peripheral and central nervous systems adapt rapidly to the presence of pain, especially in response to tissue damage. This adaptive process is called neuronal plasticity. In some situations, neuronal plasticity can lead to prolonged changes in the pathways that are involved in detecting and processing nociceptive stimuli, resulting in chronic pain syndromes. The specific changes in key neurotransmitters and receptors differ between chronic pain states, with implications for the efficacy of treatments. For example, µ-opioid receptors are down-regulated in neuropathic pain, potentially leading to limited opioid responsiveness.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0040"><ce:section-title id="st0040">Peripheral sensitisation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0180">Peripheral sensitisation can occur in association with a variety of clinical conditions, including sepsis, cancer, inflammatory disease, injury, surgery and obesity. The final common pathway by which sensitisation takes place in all of these conditions is inflammation. Inflammation is accompanied by increased capillary permeability and tissue oedema with the release of a diverse range of mediators, including bradykinin, hydrogen ions, prostaglandins and adenosine, which bind to receptors and ion channels on nociceptors of primary afferent neurons (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0130" refid="f0020">Fig. 34.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0020"/>). The signalling pathways activated by these mediators generate action potentials, which are transmitted by sensory neurons to the spinal cord. If these pain-provoking stimuli persist, the activation threshold of sensory neurons is reduced, resulting in an increased transmission of pain signals to the spinal cord.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0045"><ce:section-title id="st0045">Central sensitisation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0185">Sensitisation may also take place at the level of the spinal cord in response to a sustained painful stimulus. It can occur acutely and rapidly, such as immediately after surgery, or may progress to chronic changes, such as chronic infection, cancer, repeated surgery or multiple traumatic episodes. Glutamate, acting via the <ce:italic>N-</ce:italic>methyl-<ce:small-caps>d</ce:small-caps>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, plays a key role in central sensitisation (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0135" refid="f0025">Fig. 34.4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0025"/>). In response to a sustained peripheral painful stimulus, increased amounts of glutamate are released in the spinal cord, overcoming the inhibitory action of magnesium ions and resulting in activation of the NMDA receptor. This initiates a cascade of intracellular signalling events that lead to prolonged modifications of somatosensory processing, with amplification of pain responses within the spinal cord and continued neuronal firing, even after the noxious stimulus has stopped. This phenomenon is termed ‘after-discharge’. In neuropathic pain, prolonged activation of the NMDA pathway results in a decrease in the number of inhibitory interneurons, which further potentiates pain.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0050"><ce:section-title id="st0050">Genetic determinants of pain perception</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0190">There are marked ethnic and individual variations in how people respond to painful stimuli and studies in twins have estimated that the heritability of CWP ranges between 30% and 50%. In the general population, the individual variants in response to pain and perception of pain are most likely due to a complex interaction between genetic and environmental influences. Few variants have been identified with robust evidence of association with CWP. Several rare syndromes have been described, however, in which insensitivity to pain or heightened pain responses occur as the result of a single gene disorder, as summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0140" refid="b0020">Box 34.3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0020"/>. Most are due to mutations affecting ion channels that play a key role in neurotransmission (see <ce:cross-ref id="crf0145" refid="f0020">Fig. 34.3</ce:cross-ref>), but other causes include mutations in the <ce:italic>NTKR1</ce:italic> gene, which encodes the receptor for nerve growth factor, and mutations in the <ce:italic>PDRM12</ce:italic> transcription factor, which is involved in neuron development.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0055"><ce:section-title id="st0055">Investigations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0200">Pain can be a presenting feature of a wide range of disorders and the first step in evaluation of a patient with pain should be to perform whatever investigations are required to define the underlying cause of the pain, unless this is already known.

Lightly touching the skin with a brush, swab or cotton-wool ball can be used to test for abnormalities of fine touch (allodynia). Assessing the patient's response to a pin-prick can be used to test for abnormalities in mechanical hyperalgesia.

The distribution of pain can be documented on a diagram of the body, on which the patient can mark the sites that are painful. Similarly, other methods have been developed with which to assess the severity of pain using verbal, numerical and behavioural rating scales. Visual scoring systems employing different facial expressions may be of value in paediatric patients and those with cognitive impairment.

Although this is time-consuming, the time invested is likely to pay dividends in improving the long-term outcome for patients. A biopsychosocial assessment takes account of the underlying neurobiology of the condition in the context of wider influences, including cognition and beliefs, emotions, and social and cultural factors. For example, an individual with abdominal pain might respond differently if a close relative had recently died of gastric cancer than if a colleague had been off work with gastric upset.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0275">An accurate clinical history is important, taking note of the duration of pain, any precipitating and relieving factors, its location and, if the pain is located at more than one site, which site is the one that impacts most on the patient's quality of life. The characteristics of the pain should be documented, by assessing whether it is described as dull, sharp, aching or burning. Associated features, such as hypersensitivity to fine touch or temperature, numbness, paraesthesia, tingling and formication (the feeling of insects crawling over the skin), should be noted. It is important to determine to what extent the pain is interfering with normal daily activities, such as work, leisure pursuits and sleep. The patient's social circumstances and cultural background should be documented, including any caring responsibilities, employment status and social and family support. The intensity of pain should also be recorded, preferably using a validated questionnaire (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0165" refid="b0025">Box 34.4</ce:cross-ref>). The patient's mood should be assessed and, if evidence of low mood is detected, a suicide risk assessment should be considered (see <ce:intra-ref id="ii0065" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00028-7#b0065">Box 28.12</ce:intra-ref>, <ce:intra-ref id="ii0070" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00028-7#s0370">p. 1187</ce:intra-ref>). The past medical and medication history should be recorded and specific enquiry made about substance misuse and any previous history of physical or mental abuse. It is also useful to enquire specifically about the patient's beliefs as to what is causing their pain, as well as what their expectation of treatment is; unless these are addressed, management may be less effective. There are some patient populations in whom particular challenges arise, often related to differences in communication ability. Strategies that can be used to overcome these difficulties are summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0170" refid="b0030">Box 34.5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0030"/>.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0105"><ce:section-title id="st0105">Examination</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0285">The patient's general appearance should be noted, including ability to walk and use of a walking aid. In those with focal pain, neurological examination should be performed, focusing particularly on any areas of abnormal sensation, reflexes and evidence of muscle wasting. A general examination should be carried out to determine whether there is any evidence of an underlying physical disorder that can account for the pain. In addition to the use of investigations to find the underlying cause of pain, patients with persistent or chronic pain may benefit from sensory testing or diagnostic nerve blocks to explore the underlying mechanisms and direct treatment. For example, a combined femoral and sciatic nerve block may be used in a patient with lower limb amputation to assess whether the pain is predominantly peripherally or centrally generated. If the pain is not improved by an effective nerve block, then peripherally directed therapies are unlikely to be effective.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0110"><ce:section-title id="st0110">Interventions</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0290">Probably the most effective mode of treatment for pain is to identify the underlying cause. Examples include the use of immunosuppressive medication in inflammatory disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy in cancer, and antimicrobial therapy in patients with infection. There are many circumstances, however, in which the underlying cause of pain cannot be treated or the treatments available are incompletely effective. Under these circumstances, several management options are available. In all cases, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary that combines pharmacological management with supported self-management, and other specific interventions when appropriate.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0115"><ce:section-title id="st0115">Supported self-management</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0295">Self-management strategies are useful in the treatment of chronic pain. Self-management works best if the patient has some understanding of their chronic pain, and acceptance that it is unlikely to resolve completely. The aim is for patients to maximise their quality of life and function <ce:italic>despite</ce:italic> ongoing pain. Support for self-management can be delivered by health-care professionals, patients who suffer from the same condition or lay people, either on an individual basis, in a group setting or, increasingly, through web-based resources. There is a strong educational component to supported self-management, which seeks to generate an interaction between patient and tutor.

Several types of exercise have been successfully used delivered in various ways, through physiotherapists, exercise classes or individual tuition. In choosing a form of exercise therapy, it is important to tailor the approach most likely to be acceptable to the individual patient. A successful exercise programme can help overcome ‘fear avoidance’, a well-recognised problem in chronic pain, where patients associate activity with an increase in pain and therefore do progressively less activity, with resultant deconditioning. Because of this it is important to pace physical activity to ensure that patients do not cycle from over-activity, with a flare in pain, to fatigue and deconditioning. This can be done by working with patients to establish their baseline level of activity and using an individually tailored, graded exercise programme (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0175" refid="b0035">Box 34.6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0035"/>). This may include normal household activities, as well as targeted exercises and stretches. Manual therapy covers a variety of hands-on treatments, including manipulation, mobilisation and massage. Manual therapy can be provided by a range of therapists, including physiotherapists, osteopaths and chiropractors. There is some evidence of short-term benefit for manual therapy but limited evidence of long-term efficacy.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0125"><ce:section-title id="st0125">Pharmacological therapies</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0375">A range of analgesics can be used in the management of chronic pain but, for most of these, the evidence of long-term benefit is limited. In general, it is advisable to use a multimodal approach in the treatment of chronic pain, choosing different drugs to target pain processing at multiple points (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0180" refid="b0040">Box 34.7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0040"/>). By employing different classes of analgesic, it is possible to use lower doses of each, thereby improving the side-effect profile. There is considerable inter-individual variability in response to analgesics, even within the same class. There are many reasons for this, including genetic variations in the enzymes that metabolise drugs. For example, the <ce:italic>CYP2D6</ce:italic> gene encodes for a liver enzyme, cytochrome P450 2D6, which metabolises a number of commonly used analgesics. Genetic variation in <ce:italic>CYP2D6</ce:italic> can influence circulating levels of many drugs, depending on whether someone is a rapid or poor metaboliser. This is particularly important if metabolites are active, as is the case with codeine and tramadol, which are metabolised to morphine. Genetic variations have also been described in the opioid receptors and downstream pathways that they affect, with good pre-clinical evidence that variations in mu opioid receptors alter analgesic response to different opioids. Because of this there is a good rationale to try different drugs, even ones from the same class, if there is an inadequate response or there are unacceptable side-effects with one agent.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0385">Whatever drug or combination of drugs is chosen, the key to successful pharmacological management is careful assessment and review, aiming for an acceptable balance between the benefits of treatment in providing pain relief, maximising function, and improving quality of life and adverse effects.

There is also some of evidence that it activates inhibitory descending spinal pathways, via a serotonergic mechanism. Other postulated mechanisms include endocannabinoid re-uptake inhibition, and inhibition of nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor alpha. For migraine and tension-type headache it has moderate efficacy at a dose of 1000 mg. It is used widely for musculoskeletal disorders and osteoarthritis, with very little high-quality evidence that it is much better than placebo, even at doses of up to 4000 mg per day. Acute liver failure is a well-recognised complication of paracetamol overdose but this risk may also be increased with long-term use, even within the recommended dose range. In view of this, it should be employed with caution in elderly patients and those weighing less than 50 kg.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0140"><ce:section-title id="st0140">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0395">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of inflammatory pain and osteoarthritis.

A single application (done by a trained health-care professional) of a high-dose 8% capsaicin patch can give around 12 weeks of pain relief for neuropathic pain and can be repeated thereafter. Capsaicin is an agonist at the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel, found on some C fibres. Capsaicin activates the channel, causing an initial sensation of heat, but an analgesic effect subsequently results due to desensitisation of the channel.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0405">Lidocaine 5% patches can also be helpful in focal neuropathic pain and should be applied for 12 hours out of 24 hours, with up to 4–6 weeks before maximum benefit is seen.

Typically, these agents do not produce an immediate reduction in pain, but rather exert an analgesic effect over a longer timeframe through their effects on central processing of pain. They are of particular value when used in combination in the management of pain with a neuropathic component but require careful dose titration over a number of weeks, to reach a dose that balances efficacy with side-effects. While the response to individual agents is variable, it is often possible to find an agent or combination of agents that works for most patients.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0155"><ce:section-title id="st0155">Opioid analgesics</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0415">Opioids are a class of drugs that target opioid receptors. The original receptor classification was based on pharmacological activity (mu, delta, kappa), with the more recent International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) classification being generally accepted in current use (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0185" refid="b0045">Box 34.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0045"/>). Opioid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors. Ligand binding activates several intracellular signalling pathways, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, as well as altering calcium and potassium permeability of neurons. Opioids are traditionally divided into subclasses of weak opioids, such as codeine and dihydrocodeine, and strong opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone. While tramadol is a weak agonist at the mu opioid receptor, it is classified as a strong opioid in some countries. The dosages and characteristics of commonly prescribed opioids are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0190" refid="b0050">Box 34.9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0050"/>. There has been a large increase in the use of strong opioids for chronic pain over the last 10–20 years. A number of factors contribute to this, including a rising incidence of chronic pain with an ageing population, reluctance to use NSAIDs because of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse effects, changes in patient expectation, societal attitudes and availability of new formulations of opioids. There is evidence of short- to medium-term benefit for strong opioids in low back pain and osteoarthritis but there have been very few good-quality studies of long-term use. Additionally, there is increasing concern about potential harm from long-term use. This includes addiction, dependence, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, endocrine dysfunction, fracture risk (especially in the elderly), overdose and cardiovascular events, with many of these adverse effects being dose-related. There is evidence that doses of more than 120 mg morphine equivalents per day are associated with increased harm, and regular review to assess ongoing benefit is needed in this patient group. A suggested strategy for using strong opioids in chronic pain is shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0195" refid="b0055">Box 34.10</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0055"/>.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0160"><ce:section-title id="st0160">Psychological therapies</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0480">The aims of psychological therapy are to increase coping skills and improve quality of life when facing the challenges of living with chronic pain.

The mechanisms are incompletely understood, although endorphin release may explain, in part, the analgesic effect. Acupuncture is particularly effective in pain related to muscle spasm, with some evidence of short-term benefit for patients with low back pain. Similar mechanisms probably apply to TENS, which is worth considering in many types of chronic pain. Neuromodulation, using implanted electrodes in the epidural space (or, more recently, adjacent to peripheral nerves), has been shown to be an effective option for neuropathic pain, including failed back surgery syndrome and chronic regional pain syndrome (see below). Specialist assessment and ongoing support is necessary, as there are many potential complications, including infection, malfunction and battery failure.

Examples include occipital nerve blocks for migraine or cervicogenic headache and trigger point injections for myofascial pain. If there is limited compression of a spinal nerve root, the nerve root injections into the epidural space may help settle symptoms and avoid the need for surgical intervention.

It can be distinguished from end-of-life care, which refers to the care of patients with far advanced, rapidly progressive disease that will soon prove fatal. The focus of palliative care is on symptom control alongside supportive care. While palliative care can and should be delivered at any stage of an incurable illness alongside optimal disease control, the focus of end-of-life care is on quality of life rather than prolongation of life or cure. Palliative care encompasses a distinct body of knowledge and skills that all good physicians must possess to allow them to care effectively for patients. Palliative care is traditionally seen as a means of managing distress and symptoms in patients with cancer, when metastatic disease has been diagnosed and death is seen as inevitable. There is, however, a growing recognition that the principles of palliative care and some of the interventions it uses are equally applicable in other conditions. Palliative may therefore be applied to any chronic disease state.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0620">For conditions other than cancer, the challenge is recognising when patients have entered the terminal phase of their illness, as there are fewer clear markers and the course of the illness is much more variable. Different chronic disease states progress at different rates, allowing some general trajectories of illness or dying to be defined (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0240" refid="f0045">Fig. 34.8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0045"/>). These trajectories are useful in decision-making for individual patients and also in planning services.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0625">The ‘rapid decline’ trajectory following a gradual decline, as occurs in cancer, is the best-recognised pattern of the need for palliative care, although a similar trajectory may be observed in other conditions, such as motor neuron disease can.

Over recent years, improvements in management of malignant disease mean that some types of cancer may follow an erratic or intermittent decline trajectory.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0630">Many chronic diseases, such as advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and intractable congestive heart failure, carry as high a burden of symptoms as cancer, as well as psychological and family distress. The ‘palliative phase’ of these illnesses may be more difficult to identify because of periods of relative stability interspersed with acute episodes of severe illness. However, it is still possible to recognise those patients who may benefit from a palliative approach to their care. The challenge is that symptom management needs to be delivered at the same time as treatment for acute exacerbations. This leads to difficult decisions as to the balance between symptom relief and aggressive management of the underlying disease. The starting point of need for palliative care in these conditions is the point at which consideration of comfort and individual values becomes important in decision-making, often alongside management of the underlying disease.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0635">The third major trajectory is categorised by years of poor function and frailty before a relatively short terminal period; it is exemplified by dementia but is also increasingly true for patients with many different chronic illnesses.

The main challenge lies in providing nursing care and ensuring that plans are agreed for the time when medical intervention is no longer beneficial.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0640">In a situation where death is inevitable and foreseeable, palliative care balances the ‘standard textbook’ approach with the wishes and values of the patient and a realistic assessment of the benefits of medical interventions.

Patients with mild pain should be started on a non-opioid analgesic drug, such as paracetamol (1 g 4 times daily) or an NSAID (step 1). If the patient fails to respond adequately or has moderate pain, a weak opioid, such as codeine (60 mg 4 times daily), should be added (step 2). This can be prescribed separately or in the form of the compound analgesic co-codamol. If pain relief is still not achieved or if the patient has severe pain, a strong opioid should be substituted for the weak opioid (step 3). If the pain is severe at the outset, strong opioids should be prescribed and increased or titrated according to the patient's response. It is important not to move ‘sideways’ (change from one drug to another of equal potency), which is a common problem during step 2 of the analgesic ladder.</ce:para><ce:section id="s0235"><ce:section-title id="st0235">Opioids</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0695">Opioid analgesia plays a key role in patients with moderate to severe pain.

The frequency of breakthrough doses should be dictated by their efficacy and any side-effects, rather than by a fixed time interval. A patient may require breakthrough analgesia as frequently as hourly if pain is severe, but this should lead to early review of the regular prescription. The patient or carer should note the timing of any breakthrough doses and the reason for them.

Pharmacological tolerance is not usually a clinically relevant problem; however, physical dependence, which is physiological, as manifest by a physical withdrawal syndrome, can occur if opioids are suddenly discontinued.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0730">Nearly all types of cancer pain respond to morphine to some degree but there is a spectrum of response, such that in some patients the dose of opioid required to control neuropathic pain and all elements of metastatic bone pain may be high and associated with unacceptable side-effects. In these situations, other methods of analgesia, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, should be explored and considered at an early stage.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0735">The most effective and appropriate route of morphine administration is oral but transdermal preparations of strong opioids (usually fentanyl) are useful in certain situations, such as in patients with dysphagia or those who are reluctant to take tablets on a regular basis. Diamorphine is a highly soluble strong opioid used for subcutaneous infusions, particularly in the last few days of life, but is only available in certain countries.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0240"><ce:section-title id="st0240">Opioid-related adverse effects</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0740">Adverse effects are a common problem with opioids, especially on initiating treatment and on increasing the dose. The most common side-effects are nausea, drowsiness, constipation and dry mouth, as summarised in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0260" refid="b0075">Box 34.14</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0075"/>. Nausea and vomiting can occur initially but usually settle after a few days. Drowsiness is usually transient at opioid initiation and dose increase. If it is persistent, an alternative opioid and/or a non-opioid should be considered. In acute dosing, respiratory depression can occur but this is rare in patients on regular opioids or in those starting on small, regular doses with appropriate titration.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0750">Tolerance usually develops to nausea, vomiting and drowsiness but not to constipation or dry mouth. All patients should therefore be prescribed a laxative, unless suffering from diarrhoea, and have access to an antiemetic and good mouth care, along with rationalisation of any concomitant medication that might exacerbate drowsiness. Newer developments include the use of preparations in which opioids are combined with opioid antagonists, such as naloxone. The naloxone is poorly absorbed and does not antagonise the systemic analgesic effect but rather acts locally to block opioid receptors in the gut, thereby reducing opioid-related constipation. Vivid dreams, visual hallucinations (often consisting of a sense of movement at the periphery of vision), delirium and myoclonus are typical of opioid-related toxicity and, if present, require urgent reassessment of the opioid dose. Biochemistry should also be checked to exclude renal impairment, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance or hypercalcaemia.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0755">Since opioid toxicity can occur at any dose, side-effects should be assessed regularly, but particularly after a dose increase. Pain should be reassessed to ensure that appropriate adjuvants are being used. Parenteral rehydration is often helpful to speed up excretion of active metabolites of morphine. The dose of opioid may need to be reduced or the opioid changed to a strong alternative.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0760">Different opioids have different side-effect profiles in different people. If a patient develops side-effects, switching to an alternative strong opioid may be helpful. Options include oxycodone, transdermal fentanyl, alfentanil, hydromorphone and occasionally methadone, any of which may produce a better balance of benefit against side-effects. Fentanyl and alfentanil have no renally excreted active metabolites and may be particularly useful in patients with renal failure. It is possible to switch between opioids but great care must be taken when doing so to make sure the dose is correct and to avoid prescribing too much or too little opioid.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0245"><ce:section-title id="st0245">Adjuvant analgesics</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0765">An adjuvant analgesic is a drug that has a primary indication other than pain but which provides analgesia in some painful conditions and may enhance the effect of the primary analgesic.

Some adjuvant analgesics may enhance the side-effect profile of the primary analgesic, and dose reductions of opioids may be required when an adjuvant analgesic is added.

They should be used as part of an overall management plan and considered when the response to drug treatment has been inadequate. Intrathecal analgesia, delivered via either an external pump or a fully implanted device, is a good option, particularly where life expectancy is more than 3 months. Coeliac plexus blocks can be helpful for visceral pain, such as in pancreatic cancer.

Patients with breathlessness should be fully assessed to determine whether there is a reversible cause, such as a pleural effusion, heart failure or bronchospasm; if so, this should be managed in the normal way. If symptoms persist, additional measures may be necessary. There are many potential causes of dyspnoea in cancer patients and in other chronic diseases; apart from direct involvement of the lungs, muscle loss secondary to cachexia, anxiety and fear can all contribute. A cycle of panic and breathlessness, often associated with fear of dying, can be dominant. Exploration of precipitating factors is important and patient education about breathlessness and effective breathing has been shown to be effective. Non-pharmacological approaches that include using a hand-held fan, pacing, and following a tailored exercise programme can help. There is no evidence to suggest that oxygen therapy reduces the sensation of breathlessness in advanced cancer any better than cool airflow, and oxygen is indicated only if there is significant hypoxia. Opioids, through both their central and their peripheral action, can palliate breathlessness. Both oral and parenteral opioids are effective. A low dose should be used initially and titrated against symptoms, unless opioids are already being prescribed for pain, in which case the existing dose can be increased further. If anxiety is considered to be playing a significant role, a quick-acting benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam (used sublingually for rapid absorption), may also be useful.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0290"><ce:section-title id="st0290">Cough</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0825">Persistent unproductive cough can be helped by opioids, which have an antitussive effect. Troublesome respiratory secretions can be treated with hyoscine hydrobromide (400–600 µg every 4–8 hours), although dry mouth is a common adverse effect. As an alternative, glycopyrronium can be useful and is given by subcutaneous infusion (0.6–1.2 mg in 24 hours).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0295"><ce:section-title id="st0295">Nausea and vomiting</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0830">The presentation of nausea and vomiting differs depending on the underlying cause, of which there are many (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0105" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00021-4#s0390">p. 780</ce:intra-ref>). Large-volume vomiting with little nausea is common in intestinal obstruction, whereas constant nausea with little or no vomiting is often due to metabolic abnormalities or adverse effects of drugs. Vomiting related to raised intracranial pressure is worse in the morning. Different receptors are activated, depending on the cause or causes of the nausea (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0280" refid="f0055">Fig. 34.10</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="f0055"/>). For example, dopamine receptors in the chemotactic trigger zone in the fourth ventricle are stimulated by metabolic and drug causes of nausea, whereas gastric irritation stimulates histamine receptors in the vomiting centre via the vagus nerve. Reversible causes, such as hypercalcaemia and constipation, should be treated appropriately. Drug-induced causes should be considered and the offending drugs stopped if possible. As different classes of antiemetic drug act at different receptors, antiemetic therapy should be based on a careful assessment of the probable causes and a rational decision to use a particular class of drug (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0285" refid="b0085">Box 34.16</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0085"/>). The subcutaneous route is often required initially to overcome gastric stasis and poor absorption of oral medicines.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0300"><ce:section-title id="st0300">Gastrointestinal obstruction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0840">Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequent complication of intra-abdominal cancer. Patients may have multiple levels of obstruction and symptoms may vary greatly in nature and severity. Surgical mortality is high in patients with advanced disease and obstruction should normally be managed without surgery. The key to effective management is to address the presenting symptoms – colic, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, intestinal secretions – individually or in combination, using parenteral drugs that do not cause or worsen other symptoms. This can be problematic when a specific treatment worsens another symptom. Cyclizine improves nausea and colic responds well to anticholinergic agents, such as hyoscine butylbromide, but both slow gut motility. Nausea will improve with metoclopramide, although this is usually contraindicated in the presence of colic because of its prokinetic effect. There is some low-level evidence that glucocorticoids (dexamethasone 8 mg) can shorten the length of obstructive episodes. Somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide, will reduce intestinal secretions and therefore large-volume vomits. Occasionally, a nasogastric tube is required to reduce gaseous or fluid distension.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0305"><ce:section-title id="st0305">Weight loss</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0845">Patients with cancer lose weight for a variety of reasons, including reduced appetite or the effects of drug treatment, or as a consequence of low mood and anxiety. There is, however, a particularly challenging syndrome associated with weight loss, which is known as cancer cachexia. This results from an alteration of metabolism caused by a complex interaction of tumour-related factors and the body's response to these factors, resulting in muscle loss, along with anorexia. Treatment involves prescribing exercise to maintain muscle mass and strengthen muscles, ensuring that there is an adequate calorie intake and providing nutritional supplements. Anti-inflammatory medication to attenuate systemic inflammation is the subject of research and many patients self-medicate with fish oil. Glucocorticoids can temporarily boost appetite and general well-being but may cause false weight gain by promoting fluid retention. Their benefits need to be weighed against the risk of side-effects, and glucocorticoids should generally be used on a short-term basis only.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0310"><ce:section-title id="st0310">Anxiety and depression</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0850">Anxiety and depression are common in palliative care but the diagnosis may be difficult, since the physical symptoms of depression are similar to those of advanced cancer. It is therefore important to realise that these symptoms are not inevitable in advanced cancer. Patients should still expect to look forward to things and to enjoy them, within the context of the situation. Simply asking the question ‘Do you think you are depressed?’ can be very useful in deciding with the patient whether antidepressants or psychological interventions may be of benefit (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0110" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00028-7#s0820">p. 1199</ce:intra-ref>). In this regard, psycho-oncology has been evolving rapidly and there is now good evidence for the role of ‘talk therapy’ in palliative care, along with other appropriate management of anxiety and depression. If antidepressants are required, citalopram and mirtazapine are good choices since they are generally well tolerated in patients with advanced disease.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0315"><ce:section-title id="st0315">Delirium and agitation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0855">Many patients become confused or agitated in the last days of life. It is important to identify and treat potentially reversible causes (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0115" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00010-X#p0845">p. 183</ce:intra-ref>), unless the patient is too close to death for this to be feasible. Early diagnosis and effective management of delirium are extremely important. As in other palliative situations, it may not be possible to identify and treat the underlying cause, and the focus of management should be to ensure that the patient is comfortable. It is important to distinguish between behavioural change due to pain and that due to delirium, as opioids will improve one and worsen the other. The management of delirium is detailed on <ce:intra-ref id="ii0125" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00010-X#s0810">page 209</ce:intra-ref>. It is important, even in the care of the actively dying patient, to treat delirium with antipsychotic medicines, such as haloperidol, rather than to regard it as distress or anxiety and use benzodiazepines only.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0320"><ce:section-title id="st0320">Dehydration</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0860">Deciding whether to give intravenous fluids can be difficult when a patient is very unwell and the prognosis is uncertain. A patient with a major stroke, who is unable to swallow but is expected to survive the event, will develop renal impairment and thirst if not given fluids and should be hydrated. On the other hand, when a patient has been deteriorating and is clearly dying, parenteral hydration needs very careful consideration and it is very important to manage this on an individual basis. Comfort and avoidance of distress in the family are the primary aims. Where a patient and family are happy with meticulous oral hygiene and care to reduce the sensation of dryness in the mouth, this is usually more appropriate and effective at the end of life than parenteral hydration, which by itself will not necessarily improve the sensation of dryness. In some patients, parenteral hydration will simply exacerbate pooling of secretions, causing noisy and distressing breathing. Each decision should be individual and discussed with the patient's family.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="s0325"><ce:section-title id="st0325">Death and dying</ce:section-title><ce:section id="s0330"><ce:section id="s0335"><ce:section-title id="st0330">Planning for dying</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0865">There have been dramatic improvements in the medical treatment and care of patients with cancer and other illnesses over recent years but the inescapable fact remains that everyone will die at some time. Planning for death should be actively considered in patients with chronic diseases when the death is considered to be foreseeable or inevitable. Doctors rarely know exactly when a patient will die but are usually aware that an individual is about to die and that medical interventions are unlikely to extend life or improve its quality significantly. Most people wish their doctors to be honest about this situation to allow them time to think ahead, make plans and address practical issues. A few do not wish to discuss future deterioration or death; if this is felt to be the case, avoidance of discussion should be respected. For doctors, it is helpful to understand an individual's wishes and values about medical interventions at this time, as this can help guide decisions about interventions. It is important to distinguish between interventions that will not provide clinical benefit (a medical decision) and those that do not confer sufficient benefit to be worthwhile (a decision that can only be reached with a patient's involvement and consent). A common example of this would be decisions about not attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0870">In general, people wish for a dignified and peaceful death and most prefer to die at home. Families also are grateful for the chance to prepare themselves for the death of a relative, by timely and gentle discussion with the doctor or other health professionals. Early discussion and effective planning improve the chances that an individual's wishes will be achieved. There are two important caveats: firstly, wishes can and do change as the terminal situation evolves, and secondly, planning in general can only be done over time as patients form a relationship with professionals and evolve an understanding of the situation in which they find themselves.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0875">Structures for assessment and planning around end-of-life care are for guidance only and the focus should evolve with the individual patient.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0340"><ce:section-title id="st0335">Diagnosing dying</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0880">When patients with cancer or other conditions become bed-bound, semi-comatose, unable to take tablets and only able to take sips of water, with no reversible cause, they are likely to be dying and many will have died within 2 days. Doctors are sometimes poor at recognising this and should be alert to the views of other members of the multidisciplinary team. A clear decision that the patient is dying should be agreed and recorded.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0345"><ce:section-title id="st0340">Management of dying</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0885">Once the conclusion has been reached that a patient is going to die in days to a few weeks, there is a significant shift in management (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0290" refid="b0090">Box 34.17</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="b0090"/>). Symptom control, relief of distress and care for the family become the most important elements of care. Medication and investigation are justifiable only if they contribute to these ends. When patients can no longer drink because they are dying, intravenous fluids are usually not necessary and may cause worsening of bronchial secretions; however, this is a decision that can be made only on an individual basis. Management should not be changed without discussion with the patient and/or family. Medicines should always be prescribed for the relief of symptoms. For example, morphine or diamorphine may be used to control pain, levomepromazine to control nausea, haloperidol to treat delirium, diazepam or midazolam to treat distress, and hyoscine hydrobromide to reduce respiratory secretions. Side-effects, such as drowsiness, may be acceptable if the principal aim of relieving distress is achieved. It is important to discuss and agree the aims of care with the patient's family. Poor communication with families at this time is one of the most common reasons for family distress afterwards and for formal complaints.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0390"><ce:section-title id="st0385">Ethical considerations</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1000">The overwhelming force in caring for any patient must be to listen to that patient and family and take their wishes on board. Patients know when health-care professionals are just receiving the information, as opposed to receiving and understanding the information in the context of the patient, their illness and needs, their carers and the socioeconomic context. It is impossible to provide holistic care for a patient without this comprehension. Every patient is unique and it is important to avoid slipping into a tick-box mentality in addressing items that should be covered in patients with advanced, incurable disease. While the key to successful palliative care is effective interdisciplinary working, every patient needs to know who has overall responsibility for their care. Trust in the whole team will come through a solid lead working with a team who are appropriately informed and in sympathy with the patient's situation, each having a clear role.</ce:para><ce:para id="p1005">Families and other carers are often unprepared for the challenge of caring for a dying person. It can be an exhausting experience, both emotionally and physically, and without a critical number of carers battle fatigue can ensue, resulting in urgent admissions. With much discussion about advance directives, we should not lose sight of the reality of changing circumstances and wishes. Good anticipatory care means not just providing for new physical symptoms, but also planning for any time when care at home becomes no longer possible.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0395"><ce:section-title id="st0390">Capacity and advance directives</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1010">The wishes of the patient are paramount in Western societies, whereas in other cultures the views of the family are equally important. If a patient is unable to express their view because of communication or cognitive impairment, that person is said to lack ‘capacity’. In order to decide what the patient would have wished, as much information as possible should be gained about any previously expressed wishes, along with the views of relatives and other health professionals. An advance directive is a previously recorded, written document of a patient's wishes (<ce:intra-ref id="ii0130" xlink:href="pii:B978-0-7020-7028-0.00032-9#s0090">p. 1307</ce:intra-ref>). It should carry the same weight in decision-making as a patient's expressed wishes at that time, but may not be sufficiently specific to be used in a particular clinical situation. The legal framework for decision-making varies in different countries.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="s0400"><ce:section-title id="st0395">Euthanasia</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p1015">In the UK and Europe, between 3% and 6% of dying patients will ask a doctor to end their life. Many of these requests are transient; some are associated with poor control of physical symptoms or a depressive illness. All expressions of a wish to die are an opportunity to help the patient discuss and address unresolved issues and problems. Reversible causes, such as pain or depression, should be treated. Sometimes, patients may choose to discontinue life-prolonging treatments, such as diuretics or anticoagulation, following discussion and the provision of adequate alternative symptom control. However, there remain a small number of patients who have a sustained, competent wish to end their lives, despite good control of physical symptoms. Euthanasia is now permitted or legal under certain circumstances in some countries but remains illegal in many others; public, ethical and legal debate over this issue is likely to continue and is often influenced by many complex non-palliative care issues.
